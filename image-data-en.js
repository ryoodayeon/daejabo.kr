        desc: `Less than a day after posting a declaration stating "We survivors will reclaim power together," the nation fell into chaos. On December 3, 2024, at 22:00, Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law under the pretext of "eradicating anti-state forces." Immediately, armed soldiers broke through windows and entered the National Assembly, and helicopters were deployed over Yeouido. Soldiers pointed guns at citizens who had gathered at the National Assembly. The martial law command issued Proclamation No. 1, threatening citizens' lives by declaring that "violators of the proclamation will be punished under martial law."

Yesterday's declaration of martial law was hastily carried out without notification to the National Assembly, violating Article 77 of the Constitution, and clearly shook the foundations of liberal democracy by attempting to shut down the National Assembly. "I witness death approaching me one step closer every day." After watching workers die in workplaces, die on isolated stages, and citizens die from various blows, I now had to watch death approaching in flames from my own home.

"We, who accumulate guilt day by day every time we take the subway on school routes permitted only to bodies that society deems capable of labor, not respecting people with disabilities as citizens," witnessed the National Assembly Station - a site of struggle where the Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination fights against discrimination - become a battleground against Yoon Seok-yeol's martial law. "And the arrows of that hostility and violence point in all directions."

"The Yoon Seok-yeol government is trampling on freedom of expression, which is both a prerequisite and requirement for the existence of democracy." While declaring martial law, they prohibited the activities of the National Assembly, local assemblies, political parties, gatherings, and demonstrations. The president's words calling the nation a den of crime are absurd. The one who is now trampling citizens' freedoms and threatening democracy is Yoon Seok-yeol himself.

"We can no longer tolerate the current regime's behavior of destroying citizens' safety and solidarity to maintain its own vested interests." Let us unite our strength to end Yoon Seok-yeol. We must advance until Yoon Seok-yeol steps down from the presidency and is punished for turning all citizens' lives into a gambling table in an instant.

We have nothing to lose. For a society where no one is arbitrarily excluded or dies, we survivors will reclaim power together with all living beings. Let us engage in an urgent struggle for the society we envision. Irresponsible Yoon Seok-yeol, who would not hesitate to destroy the nation for his own interests, must step down immediately!

        desc: `We stand once again upon the history of democratization written in blood by our senior Korea University students 64 years ago. Now, 20,000 Korea University students stand before the spirit of democracy that history has won and the foundation of student society. We must resist all oppression and be free in our political daily lives.

On December 3rd, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared the first martial law since the era of dictatorship. In his address to the nation, he mentioned "the prototype of national ruin that has been committing evil deeds, anti-state forces" as targets for elimination. Proclamation No. 1 was issued by Martial Law Commander Army General Park An-su. The preamble of the proclamation mentioned "anti-state forces lurking within the free Republic of Korea and plotting to subvert the system."

We cannot help but ask: Who are the anti-state forces that sought to subvert our liberal democracy? Who are the anti-state forces that threatened constitutionalism with martial law that was unconstitutional in both content and procedure? Who are the anti-state forces that destroyed the principle of separation of powers by blockading the National Assembly and deploying military forces? Who exactly are the anti-state forces that tried to deprive the sovereign people of their freedom of association and assembly, intimidating the principles of popular sovereignty and self-governance? Who exactly, exactly are those "forces" that established the revival of anti-communist ideology, dividing national opinion and subverting liberal democracy?

Free and creative pursuit of truth is the eternal mission of the university, and resisting all internal and external forces that attempt to violate this is the inalienable right and duty of university members. The very first sentence of Korea University Student Council Constitution preamble reads thus: Our student society must cry out for democracy by resisting all injustice, and we cannot help but take upon ourselves the role of being the nation's torch that protects freedom and justice and reveals truth in the face of any oppression.

Are we truly living in an age of democracy? The night of doubt is over and the morning of conviction has dawned. The heinous martial law forces were frustrated within 3 hours and sank within 6 hours. They could not stop the resistance of the people who are the sovereign of this nation, the consensus of the National Assembly as the hall of public will, or the voice of the media as a channel of truth.

Now student society must join voices that seek to resist injustice. We must firmly reject all oppression that seeks to suppress democracy. It is time to rise up so that through our resistance and freedom, we can bring anti-democratic insurrectionist forces and all enemies of democracy before the tribunal of history.

We are the youth of a liberal democratic state. We can gather anywhere, anytime to explore academics and expand forums for dialogue. We can proudly enjoy the freedom of assembly and expression guaranteed by our Constitution. We can listen to various stories from the world anytime, and we can raise our voices to make our stories heard. We want to research what we want to research, constantly question, and become mature citizens of society. Beyond just our individual rights, we act for social progress and the maturation of democracy.

Remembering the Korea University spirit that fought for the achievement of democracy, we firmly reject all attempts to suppress democracy. Therefore, if this nation's anti-democratic government once again declares a transition to a dictatorial state, we Korea University students declare that, just as our senior Korea University students did, we will be the first, anytime, and gladly volunteer to be anti-state forces, and resolve as follows:

One. Judge the martial law and insurrectionist forces before the Constitution.
One. We oppose unconstitutional martial law.
One. We condemn all oppression against liberal democracy.
One. We will protect democracy against all injustice.

Burn down oppression!

Korea University Culture opposes President Yoon Seok-yeol's unconstitutional, illegal, and anti-state declaration of martial law. Yoon Seok-yeol is an insurrectionist who attempted to overthrow the state through unconstitutional martial law. The martial law was nothing more than a palace coup.

Yoon Seok-yeol's so-called martial law declaration and subsequent military martial law is an act that insults the people who hold true sovereignty and an attempt to shake the foundations of democracy. Yoon Seok-yeol invoked martial law under the pretext of "protecting" "liberal democracy," attempted to obstruct the normal functioning of the National Assembly, and threatened the people with military force. What does he intend to make free and what does he intend to protect? Are the freedom, democracy, state, and people mentioned in his address truly alive?

What needs to be eradicated and overthrown is not "pro-North Korea" or "anti-state forces," but Yoon Seok-yeol himself.

There has never been martial law "for the people." We reject the justifications of martial law proclaimed under the banner of national reconstruction. We must not forget what kind of martial law we have experienced and endured. Countless citizens died and were injured by state violence under the guise of "national security."

Korea University Culture will take the lead in confronting dictatorship. We remember the history of countless citizens who shed blood in Gwangju in May 1980 and throughout the nation in June 1987.

As a resistance media that transforms the world, we Korea University Culture will resist Yoon Seok-yeol's anti-constitutional acts.

Overcome fear and resist!

        desc: `Last night, it is evident that we experienced the fall of liberal democracy. Around 22:20 on December 3, 2024, we faced martial law for the first time in 45 years. President Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law through an emergency briefing, claiming it was to eradicate pro-North Korean anti-state forces that plunder the people's freedom and happiness, and to protect the free constitutional order.

Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution specifies that martial law can be declared "in wartime, emergency, or equivalent national emergency when it is necessary to respond to military needs with armed forces or maintain public peace and order." However, on the night of December 3rd, there was no emergency concerning national existence, and it is clear that the constitutional order was destroyed by the declaration of martial law that violated the Constitution and laws.

President Yoon Seok-yeol must stop the arbitrariness and arrogance of power and take stern responsibility for declaring martial law. When declaring martial law, far from notifying the National Assembly, he designated the National Assembly—which conveys the people's will—as anti-state forces and attempted to blockade the National Assembly by dispatching martial law troops. This is absolutely unacceptable.

The martial law declared under the pretext of protecting the free constitutional order is equivalent to pushing liberal democracy off a cliff. The truly undemocratic measures of controlling media and publications and restricting the freedom of assembly and association bring overwhelming dismay.

Sogang University Student Council pledges in the preamble of its constitution to reflect on the blood and sweat of proud predecessors who fought for the construction of a democratic society with the goal of building a student council for the pursuit of equal rights based on beliefs in human dignity and justice and love in human relationships.

We seek to fulfill our previous pledge and express deep anger and concern about President Yoon Seok-yeol's senseless behavior last night. This is an act that tramples on the efforts and sacrifices of countless citizens who sought to protect democracy, and violence that fundamentally denies the principle of popular sovereignty specified in the Constitution.

Democracy may waver but will not collapse, and can never be reduced to a tool of power. The voices of Sogang people who yearn for justice and freedom will remain vivid even under oppression.

We strongly condemn President Yoon Seok-yeol's actions of damaging constitutional values in the name of martial law, trampling on citizens' rights, and plunging our society into a quagmire.

This was the first such event in 44 years since 1980, and an unprecedented situation since the constitutional system of 1987. Yoon Seok-yeol stated that he "declared martial law with resolute will to save the nation against anti-state forces that paralyze the essential functions of the state and seek to collapse the liberal democratic constitutional order."

This declaration of martial law is clearly an act that tramples on the liberal democratic constitutional order of the Republic of Korea. Yoon Seok-yeol's declaration of martial law is clearly unconstitutional and illegal according to Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Martial Law Act.

Beyond partisan conflict, Yoon Seok-yeol's declaration of martial law is an unjust act that relegates the National Assembly—the representative institution of the people—to pro-North Korean anti-state forces and dismisses the decisions of state institutions as disruption.

Yoon Seok-yeol's justification for declaring martial law to rebuild the free Republic of Korea that is falling into the abyss of national ruin has instead led the free constitutional order into that very abyss of ruin.

What is even more tragic is that this undemocratic martial law threatened and attempted to trample even our academic halls. The proclamation restricted freedom of press, publication, assembly, and association, showing no respect for our halls that should have been filled with vitality through free criticism and discussion.

We will never stand by and watch darkness cast over the torch of truth. We will kindle the flame with our voices. We hope that our will to brighten the light of our people will never dim, and that our democratic steps moving forward will not collapse before undemocratic acts.

If state power does not protect the values of democracy, we will gladly resist that power and overthrow injustice. We condemn Yoon Seok-yeol's act of ruthlessly trampling the April 19th democratic ideals that resist injustice.

This is an unprecedented situation since the constitutional system of 1987, occurring for the first time in 44 years since 1980, and is an absolutely unacceptable act.

When Yoon Seok-yeol was inaugurated as president, he swore to uphold the Constitution and defend the nation. However, last night's declaration of martial law, the proclamation of martial law command orders, and the entry of martial law troops into the National Assembly main building were clearly anti-constitutional acts of disrupting the national constitution.

He did not notify the National Assembly, which is the Republic of Korea's sole legislative body, did not follow the legal procedures specified in the Constitution, and attempted to illegally occupy the National Assembly—a constitutional institution—by mobilizing martial law troops. This can never be seen as serving the purpose of protecting the "free constitutional order."

Seoul National University of Science and Technology, as the Republic of Korea's only public comprehensive university, strongly condemns this incident that seeks to damage the national polity.

Therefore, the Seoul National University of Science and Technology Student Council, in accordance with the preamble and Article 9 of the Seoul National University of Science and Technology Student Council Constitution, which pledges to secure students' human rights by resisting oppression and coercion, and by the spirit of students and citizens who pledge to illuminate the darkness of the times with justice and truth, demands the following:

One. Yoon Seok-yeol must apologize for anti-democratic acts that damage the April 19th spirit and May 18th spirit, and anti-constitutional behavior that destroyed the rights of association, assembly, and demonstration and the freedom of press and publication.

One. Yoon Seok-yeol must clearly reveal the reasons for declaring martial law before the people and apologize for creating anxiety through a series of measures following the martial law declaration.

One. The government must acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the martial law incident and establish and implement measures for national recovery.

The Seoul National University of Science and Technology Student Council will continue resistance against injustice and violence through solidarity among student societies until the above demands are completely fulfilled.

President Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law claiming it was to protect liberal democracy and ensure citizens' safety from anti-state forces' threats of system subversion, but this can only be described as undemocratic behavior that violated the Constitution in both procedure and content.

Furthermore, he announced proclamations restricting citizens' basic rights and suppressed the political freedoms that should naturally be enjoyed as democratic citizens. The proclamations, which controlled media and publications, prohibited strikes and assemblies, and included provisions allowing immediate arrest of all citizens opposing martial law, are hard to believe were written in 2024. Although the martial law was lifted according to the National Assembly's resolution, President Yoon Seok-yeol ignored the principle clearly stated in the Constitution that "all power comes from the people."

Even immediately after declaring martial law, President Yoon Seok-yeol violated the procedure stipulated in Article 77, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, which states "the President must notify the National Assembly without delay when declaring martial law," ignoring even the procedures established by the supreme law. Even in a martial law situation, the President has no constitutional authority to dissolve parliament or prevent the convening of the legislature. Nevertheless, President Yoon Seok-yeol took extra-legal measures by deploying troops to the National Assembly building.

President Yoon Seok-yeol remains silent even now. Even when lifting martial law, there was no mention of any apology. The reckless and irresponsible words of a powerbroker have caused serious damage across politics, society, economy, and diplomacy. We, who stayed up all night with sleepless eyes worrying about our tomorrows and concerned about our community's future, are still silently boarding buses today, attending classes, and maintaining our daily lives. However, through last night's events, we realized how easily our ordinary and natural daily life can collapse.

Therefore, we wish to cry out. Since ancient times, our predecessors have raised their voices based on the spirit of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom to guide the nation on the right path. Following the spirit of those who conveyed their intentions through petitions, it is no coincidence that Sungkyunkwan people are appealing in the face of situations that were unimaginable. In order not to be ashamed before the patriotic martyrs and alumni who fought for democracy, the 57th Sungkyunkwan University Student Council Joint Central Executive Committee strongly condemns President Yoon Seok-yeol's illegal declaration of martial law.

President Yun Seok-yul's declaration of emergency martial law, which threatens democracy and constitutional order.

On December 3, 2024, at around 10 p.m., President Yoon declared martial law throughout the Republic of Korea. Through Decree No. 1, the Martial Law Command banned all political activities, including the activities of the National Assembly, local councils, political parties, political associations, rallies, and demonstrations, and restricted all freedom of speech and publication. Martial law is only allowed in extremely limited circumstances, such as wartime or a national emergency as defined by the Constitution. However, President Yun declared martial law under circumstances where none of the requirements for martial law were met. This is an unconstitutional and unacceptable move.

The most unacceptable act in a democratic society is to use any form of violence to intimidate members of a community. The refusal to recognize differences and the desire to destroy is the most unacceptable behavior in a democracy. However, instead of running the country through dialogue, debate, and respect for each other, the president, who bears the greatest responsibility for protecting the freedom and rights of the people, has mobilized the military, which is supposed to protect the people, to flaunt his power with guns and create insecurity. We condemn President Yun as a serious betrayal of democracy.

Nevertheless, the fact that the martial law situation did not deteriorate or turn into a bloodbath was due to the courage of many citizens who were outraged by the declaration of martial law, and the right choice of many public officials who immediately pointed out the problems with the emergency martial law, regardless of partisanship. It was an event that confirmed that even if some people in power make wrong judgments, mature citizens can stop them and defend democratic values. As future generations exploring the study of truth and freedom at Yonsei University, the Yonsei University Student Government Association will continue to point out the seriousness of this incident and demand accountability from President Yoon Seok-yul and those involved.

We remember the voices of students and citizens that rang out on campus and in the public square in June 1987. We recognize that the Yonsei University Student Association is once again faced with the urgent task of speaking out in defense of democracy in Korea. We will continue to defend democracy and constitutional values through active actions, just as we have stood up for justice in every moment of oppression. We will also continue peaceful resistance in solidarity with all citizens who love democracy in accordance with the interests and demands of our fellow students.

Then came May 18th in Gwangju. 45 years have passed. Yesterday, on December 3, 2024, at 10 PM, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law and blockaded the National Assembly. Martial Law Commander Park An-su stated through a proclamation that "strikes, work slowdowns, and assembly activities that incite social disorder are prohibited."


Do assembly activities, work slowdowns, and strikes really incite social disorder? Are the citizens in the squares anti-state forces? Are the National Assembly members a criminal group? Are the media conveying truth on the streets false propaganda forces?
What kind of nation did President Yoon Suk-yeol intend to create by pushing aside these countless anti-state forces, criminal groups, and false propaganda forces? What kind of "social disorder" were they trying to suppress, and where exactly were they seeking to find their "order"?


We have already seen the answer countless times throughout history. We saw it in the martyrs of Gwangju in May 1980. We saw it in the burned Labor Standards Act of 1970, at the main gate of Yonsei University in June 1987, and in the farmer who fell to water cannons in 2015.
If the only way to achieve order is by declaring martial law, deploying helicopters, pushing forward with armored vehicles, breaking windows, and pointing guns at citizens, then we don't need such order. Your order has already lost support. Power without citizens' consent is merely violence.


Nevertheless, if you attempt to enforce that order through violence, we will resist.
The Yonsei University Irregular Workers' Joint Committee stands in solidarity with discriminated disabled people, sexual minorities, women, and children as members of society. As part of the Yonsei community, we stand in solidarity with campus minorities, facility management workers, irregular faculty, and lecturers.


The Joint Committee fulfills its duty as citizens of a democratic society. We stand in solidarity as citizens and join forces to resist violence. If the state calls this duty social disorder, then we will rightfully become disorder and stand against an order that oppresses citizens, destroys freedom, and threatens lives.


We demand of President Yoon Suk-yeol:

Immediately apologize for intimidating the people with groundless martial law
Clearly investigate the process and responsibility of martial law implementation
Take responsibility for this entire situation and immediately step down from the presidency

        desc: `On December 3, 2024, the Republic of Korea faced a critical crisis that fundamentally shook the Constitution and the foundations of democracy. President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law was a dangerous and reckless act that destroyed constitutional order and targeted the heart of democracy. We strongly condemn this attempt to ruthlessly trample upon the freedom and rule of law that the Republic of Korea has built through long struggles and sacrifices.

Although martial law was withdrawn due to the resolute resistance of the people and the National Assembly, we clearly state that the very attempt to invoke it was an unacceptable and grave criminal act against the constitutional order.

According to Article 77 of the Constitution, martial law can only be invoked as a last resort during wartime, national emergencies, or situations of comparable dire crisis. This is an extremely limited measure for the protection of people's lives and national survival, and must never be abused under any circumstances. But did this attempt at martial law truly meet these requirements? We firmly answer "No."

This attempt was a direct denial of constitutional spirit and democratic values, reminiscent of the oppressive measures used to suppress people's rights during past authoritarian regimes. President Yoon Suk-yeol's attempt to invoke martial law is a blatant and grave challenge to the rule of law and democracy. This is clearly an anti-constitutional act, as state power that should protect the Constitution instead tried to trample on people's freedom and employ illegal means to maintain their own power.

We make it clear that the withdrawal of martial law is not the end of this problem. Wonkwang University and all citizens demand clear explanations regarding the legal and political legitimacy of this martial law declaration. We must thoroughly investigate how this attempt was made, whether there was a real threat to national survival, and whether all legal and political means other than martial law were sufficiently considered.

This incident cannot be dismissed as a simple mistake or misjudgment. It contains clear intent to destroy democracy and violate people's fundamental rights, and we will hold those responsible thoroughly accountable. We demand to know who the final decision-maker was and how they will be held responsible.

The attempt to invoke martial law was a serious challenge to the Republic of Korea's democracy and rule of law, and such actions can never be forgiven. We intend to pursue responsibility from the President and related individuals around him to the very end.

This incident clearly revealed how easily the Republic of Korea's democracy and rule of law can be threatened. As sovereign holders under the Constitution, the people must raise strong voices to ensure such illegal attempts are never repeated. Silence is tantamount to allowing the abuse of power.

We regard this incident as a watershed moment for protecting democracy, and we firmly reject all attempts to violate the Constitution and people's fundamental rights. We will pursue responsibility for the martial law attempt to the end and demand severe punishment for those who violated constitutional principles and people's rights.

The Wonkwang University student community clearly states our position through this declaration. All unjust attempts to damage the noble values of freedom, justice, and democracy must be firmly condemned. No acts that violate people's rights and threaten constitutional order can be tolerated, and our anger runs deep.

We will continue with a responsible attitude to the end to protect democracy and justice and restore the correct direction of history. Our resolve to defend democracy in this land will continue unwavering.

On the night of December 3rd, we witnessed the collapse of democracy and constitutional order.

On the night of December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law with "resolute national salvation will to counter anti-state forces attempting to collapse the liberal democratic constitutional order." Helicopter sounds were heard over the city center, and the National Assembly was blockaded. Armed soldiers broke windows and entered the National Assembly. Faced with the tragic reality that this is not content from a history book, we feel a sense of mission in the name of Ewha, which has created a history of liberation.

Who are the anti-state forces that collapse constitutional order? 
President Yoon Suk-yeol has damaged the history of democracy built with blood through his declaration of emergency martial law for the first time in 44 years. The one who takes away the freedom of the people and the press. The one who violated the Constitution. The one who damages democracy. President Yoon Suk-yeol himself is the anti-state force that destroys constitutional order. The people are feeling enormous anger beyond shock and dismay. After the declaration of martial law, citizens including university students desperately gathered at the National Assembly to lift martial law, and the emergency martial law was lifted with the approval of 190 National Assembly members. But it's not over yet. President Yoon Suk-yeol, who tried to erase the history of democracy and liberation created by the people using the power given by the people, must be judged by the people's hands.

We will protect the history of democracy and liberation that Ewha has created.
Ewha has written the history of democracy and liberation until now. In June 1987, students' class boycotts and the declaration by 17 Ewha professors created the democracy of today. And in 2016, with the power of Ewha people, we forced former President Choi Kyung-hee to resign and created the signal for Park Geun-hye's impeachment. Also, in that process, we created the first direct presidential election system among private universities, laying the foundation for democracy in university society.

Since Ewha has always continued the history of liberation at the forefront of democracy, we will definitely protect democracy against the Yoon Suk-yeol administration's emergency martial law measures that shake constitutional order in 2024.

        desc: `The Jeonbuk National University Student Council expresses deep concern regarding President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law. This measure is an act that seriously violates citizens' freedom and rights, which are fundamental principles of democracy.

Yoon Suk-yeol's surprise declaration of emergency martial law is a deplorable act where the government has turned away from communication with the people, strengthened dictatorial rule, and abandoned the government's primary duty to protect citizens' rights and respect democratic procedures.

We feel deep disappointment and anger at this absolutely unacceptable situation where the government suppresses the people's voices and considers them illegal.

At Jeonbuk National University, where the spirit of Senior Lee Se-jong, who organized the April 4th demonstration that was the beginning of the April 19th Revolution and was the first victim of the May 18th Democratization Revolution, lives on, the Student Council will do everything in its power to defend the justice and human rights of fellow students. This will serve as proof that democracy must be protected and how condemnable illegal and improper methods of governance truly are.

Hoping that our voices will not be silenced, the Jeonbuk National University Student Council strongly condemns Yoon Suk-yeol's emergency martial law.

We cannot help but feel indignant at the arbitrary, illegal, and unilateral declaration of emergency martial law that ignored the procedures established by the Constitution and laws.

The National Assembly, the hall of public will, was trampled by military boots, and it seemed as if constitutional spirit and citizens' fundamental rights were of no concern whatsoever. Due to this unprecedented situation that occurred for the first time in 44 years, our people spent the night in fear and confusion.

According to Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, the President may declare martial law in accordance with the provisions of law when it is necessary to meet military needs with armed forces or to maintain public peace and order in times of war, armed conflict, or comparable national emergency situations. However, we cannot understand which constitutional requirements this emergency martial law declaration corresponds to.

Beyond conflicts of political ideology, this emergency martial law declaration is an unjust measure with no justification whatsoever. It drove the people into fear and damaged the democratic values that the people have protected.

We condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's such irrational and undemocratic actions.

The Jeju National University Student Council, descendants of April 3rd, will continue to raise our voices and stand against injustice to prevent the repetition of painful history caused by unjust public authority and to protect the democracy that our predecessors fought against oppression and suppression to preserve.

        desc: `Feminist University Press Editorial Committee Joint Statement

At 22:23 on December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol began an emergency address and declared emergency martial law. Despite being obstructed by restrictions on National Assembly access and intrusion by martial law troops, at 01:02 on the 4th, National Assembly members passed a resolution demanding the lifting of emergency martial law. Despite Martial Law Commander Army General Park An-su's martial law command proclamation, citizens gathered at the National Assembly to express their opposition. About 3 hours after the resolution was passed, at 04:27, President Yoon lifted martial law.

President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law is an unconstitutional act that did not follow proper procedures. The gun barrels aimed at the people by sending the military to the National Assembly will not be forgiven under any excuse. Martial law directly oppresses people's freedom, and pressure on National Assembly members is a threat to democracy. To be clear, "the obvious anti-state act of plotting rebellion by trampling the constitutional order of the free Republic of Korea and disrupting state institutions established by the Constitution and law" is President Yoon's declaration of martial law on December 3rd.

President Yoon declared emergency martial law and called the impeachment of the Minister of Public Administration and Security, Chairman of the Korea Communications Commission, Board of Audit and Inspection Chairman, attempted impeachment of the Defense Minister, and judge impeachments acts of paralyzing administration and judiciary. But what has President Yoon's behavior been like? He ignored personnel hearing results and forced through unfit appointments. Budget deliberation is the legislature's inherent authority. 

It was none other than the Yoon government that ignored the legislature's proposal that budgets with cuts could be changed through amendments and agreements. The National Assembly members who engage in "legislative pushing through with numbers" are not legislative dictators, but sit in those positions by people's choice. The Yoon government's exercise of reconsideration rights, namely veto power, is the collapse of separation of powers and wielding the administrative sword.

Calling these acts plotting rebellion and labeling them as pro-North forces and anti-state forces while calling for their eradication does not align with the values of 'liberal democracy.' What is the liberal democracy that President Yoon speaks of? Is it intimidating people with guns and swords and taking away freedom of press, publication, and association? The Yoon government itself is trampling constitutional order and plotting rebellion. President Yoon Suk-yeol and the martial law forces must face constitutional judgment according to the gravity of their crimes.
In January 2022, when President Yoon Suk-yeol was a presidential candidate, he left seven characters on his SNS: "Abolish Ministry of Gender Equality and Family." Even after taking power, he consistently dismissed gender discrimination as a personal problem and denied structural gender discrimination. The Republic of Korea has ranked first among OECD member countries in gender wage gap for 27 years since 1996. Can we still say there is no structural gender discrimination?

The Yoon government, which claimed there was no structural gender discrimination, completely cut the budget for employment equality counseling offices that had been operating nationwide for 24 years this year. Through budget cuts and restructuring including transfer to the Ministry of Employment and Labor, they caused institutions to lose their purpose and function. Furthermore, the Yoon government's policy of introducing foreign domestic workers has led to the entrenchment of low wages and deterioration of working conditions for female workers. The Yoon government put aside its duty to solve gender discrimination problems and, with the stance that there is no structural gender discrimination, approved gender discrimination and legitimized misogyny in society.

President Yoon Suk-yeol must deeply feel responsibility for all these acts against the values of liberal democracy and gender equality and step down.

However, resignation is not the end. We must not repeat the regression of women's rights that the Yoon Suk-yeol government has committed over the past three years. Therefore, Korea University feminist magazine Seoksun, Sungkyunkwan University feminist magazine Jeongjeong-heon, Sookmyung Women's University autonomous media Paran, Ewha Womans University central autonomous media Ewha Journal, and Chung-Ang University feminist magazine Nokji have resisted the Yoon government's misogynistic politics and will continue to write and speak without hesitation. As women who declared ourselves democratic citizens of society, we hold the Yoon government accountable for its martial law declaration that violates the constitutional spirit and condemn all anti-democratic acts.

True democracy that will be rebuilt cannot be achieved without feminism. At this historic turning point, we cry out women's issues that have always been postponed - we cry out to survive. Feminism can no longer just watch.

As feminists, we pledge through this writing to most wisely understand and resist this era of regression and backlash.

December 3, 2024. Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law. Along with an utterly absurd address stating "emergency martial law to completely eradicate pro-North anti-state forces and protect the free constitutional order," the martial law command suspended the National Assembly and local assemblies and prohibited all political activities. It also censored publications and issued anachronistic proclamations predicting 'punishment' for violators of proclamations.

Following Yoon Suk-yeol and the martial law command's orders, martial law troops forcibly infiltrated the National Assembly, a legislative institution, attempted to arrest ruling and opposition party figures, and finally invaded the National Election Commission, a constitutional institution. All these acts were clearly a "palace coup" carried out systematically under President Yoon Suk-yeol's orders.

According to Article 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Korea is a democratic republic, sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people, and all power comes from the people. However, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law without proper procedures or justification, staging a palace coup. Even after lifting martial law, his arrogant behavior of taking not an ounce of responsibility has the entire nation boiling with anger. 

At this place where Cardinal Kim Soo-hwan's spirit resides, 8,000 Catholic University students demand Yoon Suk-yeol's resignation for the following crimes:
First, He mocked all citizens through illegal emergency martial law.
Second, He actively led rebellion by mobilizing martial law troops to stage a palace coup.
Third, As president of a democratic republic, he committed unconstitutional acts worthy of disqualification.

Listen, Yoon Suk-yeol! We resolve with firm determination that we will protect democratic values from you who mock democratic values, we will gladly resist power from you who resist with veto power, and we will stand against injustice from you who falsely claim justice.
Yoon Suk-yeol must resign immediately.

On the night of December 3, 2024, President Yun Seok-yul declared emergency martial law, a decision that defies the history of democracy in South Korea. Police forces were mobilized to block the National Assembly's move to lift martial law, and the confrontation between soldiers with guns and citizens was a reminder of the deep wounds shared by all Koreans. President Yun abused his position to undermine the fundamental principles of democracy and a democratic state guaranteed by the Constitution. Freedom of speech and publication was restricted, and the time when basic rights were restricted was darker than night. The Yun government trampled on people's rights under the guise of martial law and illegally intimidated people with guns.

Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. It is not just a sentence, but a fundamental right that must be guaranteed. However, President Yun Seok-yul has taken away the voice of the people for his own security. We declare. We will not be silenced for the voice of democracy, even if they try to take away our pens with violence. The Independent Press Union of Catholic University of Korea does more than just record and transmit what is said on campus; we take up the pen for a democratic student society and a free press. We will never turn a blind eye to dictatorships that shake the foundations of democracy.

We strongly demand that those responsible for the emergency martial law that suppresses people's freedoms and basic rights be held strictly accountable. The abuses of Yoon's government will be recorded in history, and we will continue the struggle to defend our democracy.

The subsequently announced proclamation completely prohibited political activities such as National Assembly, local assembly, and political party activities, and restricted all freedom of press, publication, and assembly.

All these procedures and contents are unconstitutional and anti-democratic acts that violate the Constitution of the Republic of Korea.

"All power comes from the people."

The people are the owners of the nation. However, for President Yoon Suk-yeol, there were no people. Through reckless and irresponsible declaration of martial law, he tried to make the Republic of Korea not the people's nation but an individual's nation.

Konkuk University Central Executive Committee has not expressed any political opinions in order to carefully represent all students' opinions.

However, we judged that this incident, which tried to destroy constitutional order and violate people's basic rights, was an act that tried to destroy Konkuk students' daily lives. Our Konkuk was built under the teaching of sincerity, trust, and righteousness (誠信義), protecting freedom of academics and thought and university autonomy, and has been a cornerstone for building true democracy. Just as our predecessors cried out for freedom in moments of oppression during the 10.28 Uprising against dictatorship, today Konkuk also cries out in moments of oppression to protect the constitutional values of free Korea.

President Yoon Suk-yeol's act of causing national anxiety for reasons that people in a democratic society cannot accept can never be justified under any circumstances.
We strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law, which turned a blind eye to the history of democracy and liberation.

President Yoon Suk-yeol must correct his anti-democratic actions and listen to the voices of the people who are the owners of the nation and students who are the nation's future. President Yoon Suk-yeol must fulfill his responsibility as the nation's highest official to protect democracy and people's rights.

Between despair (絶望) and earnest hope (切望), our Konkuk will voice our resolve to the end to protect the democracy of free Korea.

On December 3, 2024, at around 10 p.m., the government of the Republic of Korea declared emergency martial law throughout the country in the name of “crushing anti-state forces and defending the free Republic of Korea.”

We strongly condemn this grave violation of the constitution and democratic principles.
Emergency martial law can only be imposed in extreme circumstances, such as a national security crisis or when the lives and safety of the people are threatened. However, Yoon's government has failed to provide a clear legal basis and crisis situation for declaring martial law. This is a clear violation of the constitution and an attempt to abuse state power to restrict civilian freedoms in a democratic society.

Emergency martial law is a means for the state to consolidate military control, suppresses freedom of political expression, assembly, and association, and can seriously violate the fundamental rights of citizens. At the core of democracy is the free and fair expression of opinions and the guarantee of rights. However, the declaration of emergency martial law threatens people's political rights and freedoms and is an attempt by the state to control its citizens. This is completely unacceptable in a country that upholds liberal democracy.
Emergency martial law risks exacerbating conflict and unrest in society and distorting the relationship between civilians and the military. It also threatens the stability and unity of the country and could sow distrust and fear throughout society. The Yoon administration does not seek to resolve social conflicts through increased military control. It should have resolved the issue through dialog and communication. Military control through emergency martial law has further divided society and is not the right way to solve the current problems.

It has brought darkness to the youth of South Korea.
The military controlled the National Assembly and the media was censored.
The people were blinded and deafened.
Every young person in Korea knows that this is not the Korea that our democratic heroes who shed their blood to defend Korea in the past had hoped for.

We are now faced with a situation where we must once again raise our voices in defense of our democracy.
President Yoon's declaration of martial law is a declaration of war against democracy. We will never give in and will continue to defend democracy with the students of Kyungpook National University.

It was a time when everyone was resting, no different from any other word, for tomorrow's well-being.

        What exactly is the "wartime, emergency, or equivalent national crisis" that President Yoon Suk-yeol speaks of? The President violated Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Martial Law Act, attempting to strip away everyone's political and social fundamental rights. He tried to paralyze the legislature and collapse the sacred principle of separation of powers, and attempted to seize control of the National Election Commission, which is a constitutional institution.

While he claimed it was to "protect the free Republic of Korea" and "safeguard the safety of our people," this measure was an unconstitutional act of violence that thoroughly ignored procedural legitimacy and legal requirements. Subsequently, Proclamation No. 1 issued under martial law violated citizens' fundamental rights by prohibiting assembly and protest activities and restricting media and publications. This was the first emergency martial law incident since democratization, representing an act that denies the democratic and constitutional values that the Republic of Korea has built over time.

This emergency martial law measure is an act that oppresses citizens' freedom and threatens the fundamental principles of democracy. In a liberal democratic state, government abuse of power can never be tolerated, and such actions have created significant anxiety among society and the people. Liberal democratic nations are difficult to collapse through leaders' decisions, and the abuse of power is simultaneously a luxury that causes unnecessary social tension.
The Student Council of Hanbat National University strongly condemns President Yoon Suk-yeol's such unconstitutional measures. We will respond through all possible means to protect our students' rights and democratic values. We recognize that emergency martial law is a serious situation that threatens students' academic freedom and rights, and we will spare no effort to correct the serious impact on students' rights and the nation's future.

Over the past decades, we will never forget the sacrifices made by our predecessors and alumni who devoted themselves to protecting democracy and freedom. They did not retreat in order to defend freedom and uphold justice, and we will inherit their will and continuously strive to protect democratic and constitutional values.

With the belief that freedom is never given but something we must defend, we strongly oppose the emergency martial law measures and will fight to the end to protect democracy and students' rights.

This was an unprecedented incident that occurred 44 years after the May 18th Democratization Movement. The preamble to the martial law command's proclamation mentioned "anti-state forces plotting to subvert the system that are operating in the shadows within the free Republic of Korea."
President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law under the pretext of preventing disruption of constitutional order, ensuring national sustainability, and taking unavoidable measures for future generations. However, the "night of martial law" that lasted approximately six hours engulfed the Republic of Korea in fundamental darkness that destroyed constitutional order, restricted citizens' rights, and undermined national security and the values of liberal democracy.

It suppressed freedom of speech and press, which are fundamental rights that all citizens of the Republic of Korea should rightfully resist when oppressed. The government even forcibly mobilized state power to seize control of the National Assembly and attempted to prevent the lifting of martial law.

How absurd is it that a government claiming to eradicate anti-state forces is not abiding by the Constitution, which is the foundation of the nation? We cannot help but be appalled.
The abuse of absolute power amplified social conflict and left lasting aftereffects. Nevertheless, Yoon Suk-yeol offered no apology and denied responsibility for declaring martial law due to constitutional disorder. The series of events that occurred during the mere six hours of emergency martial law declaration and withdrawal left indelible wounds on the people and caused significant social chaos. Our ordinary daily lives collapsed in an instant due to a single irresponsible word from the head of state. The "night of martial law" in 2024 is clearly a regressive measure.

In 1980, martial law, which we believed would be the last, was lifted, and time passed to 2024. A generation for whom democracy had been natural since birth, we who had become wearily familiar with the word "martial law," now faced actual violence.

Together with the aged martyrs of the April 19th Revolution who sacrificed themselves for the noble values of liberal democracy in the Republic of Korea, and with our predecessors who valiantly resisted great injustice, we yearn for justice. The considerable history we had hoped for has never died, not even for a moment. Justice lives and breathes proudly under the name and footsteps of the people of Dongguk, within Dongguk's breath.

The consequences of his irresponsible actions and failure to make the right choices must be borne by the youth who will be responsible for the future of Korea.

The power elected by the people had become a weapon to terrorize the people.

We used to teach that we live in a democratic society, but now we can't say that.

As preservice teachers, we feel a sense of responsibility to protect democracy.  
In a democratic society, Seoul National University of Education aims to educate students to become 'educators with a democratic spirit'. As musk people, we have a mission to teach children in a democratic society. We must not allow the democratic spirit to be violated again.

We will act so that one day, when we teach in 2024, we can say, “We made democracy work.

        desc: `--Yoon Suk-yeol, who threatened democracy and human rights with unconstitutional martial law declaration, must step down immediately-

On the night of December 3rd, we faced the utterly unbelievable word "martial law." We had to witness the gagging of opposition lawmakers' mouths in parliament, the silencing of graduates at graduation ceremonies, and now we had to see and hear the violent sophistry of gagging the people's mouths "for the freedom and happiness of the people."

However, we also witnessed the failure of the regime's attempt to suppress and erase voices that did not suit their taste. Even on that cold and dark night when martial law was declared, countless people rushed to the National Assembly, shouting for the abolition of martial law and guarding the place until dawn.

They gagged our mouths. From its very beginning, the Yoon Suk-yeol regime has continuously ignored and oppressed the voices of citizens speaking of freedom, happiness, and life. They declared martial law. Under a regime that disregards human rights and democracy, the scope of exclusion and violence has only expanded. Nevertheless, the voices did not cease, and they will never cease in the future. Here we weave together the voices and words that the regime tried to erase.

"During his tenure, Yoon Suk-yeol has greatly damaged the three basic labor rights by oppressing numerous labor unions including construction unions, and has caused labor human rights to regress by exercising veto power against the 'Yellow Envelope Law.' The power that trampled on workers' voices now points its gun barrel at none other than all citizens. Today, when we have reached the point of declaring unconstitutional emergency martial law, we cry out loudly that we can no longer stand by and watch the violation of democracy and popular sovereignty." (Bitsori)

"It is no coincidence that the regime's violence, which would threaten everyone's safety through martial law, was first mobilized to suppress workers' voices. Working citizens are workers, and workers living in society are citizens, yet the state and capital have always employed rhetoric that separates workers and citizens while perpetrating labor oppression. This is because they fear the historical memory that workers have led in constituting and deepening democracy. They fear the fact that workers who struggle to expand democracy beyond voting rights to workplaces and daily life are the driving force of democratic vitalization. The regime that tried to deny through violence and hatred the democracy built by workers from martyr Jeon Tae-il through the great worker struggles of July, August, and September 1987, and the cries of today's precarious workers seeking to overcome deep discrimination, has ultimately turned all citizens into enemies through anti-human rights coup attempts." (Biseogong)

"Yoon Suk-yeol's sudden December 3rd martial law coup that threatened citizens' lives is not unrelated to the Yoon Suk-yeol government's consistent course of disregarding life. The Yoon Suk-yeol government has caused fatal harm to marine life by supporting the discharge of Fukushima contaminated water, destroyed non-human animals' habitats and accelerated the climate crisis through large-scale lifting of development restriction areas and gas field development projects, resulting in millions of non-human animal deaths annually from fires, heat strokes, and heavy rains. And due to the Yoon Suk-yeol government's neglect of climate crisis response duties, threats to life have been extending to humans vulnerable to climate disasters through heavy rain casualties and increases in heat-related deaths, which the Yoon Suk-yeol government has ignored. This martial law is the result of the Yoon Suk-yeol government's disregard for life while acting only for its own interests and safety, and we can no longer tolerate Yoon Suk-yeol's disregard for life." (Nubigens)

"The incident we witnessed is an unprecedented situation that occurred for the first time in 44 years, and is the result of irrational and senseless judgment by someone sitting in the heavy position of president. Yoon Suk-yeol, who rose to the presidency by driving numerous beings outside the fence of citizenship as abnormal, has shown behavior throughout his term of only taking care of the interests of the privileged, concealing corruption, and abusing power. And that day, Yoon Suk-yeol once again personally proved how much that fence can be used by power as an illusion. That day, the military, an organization that exists to protect the people, was mobilized to the front of the National Assembly solely for private gain, pointing guns at those who raised their voices to rebuild democracy. That day, martial law by its very existence easily drove these people outside the fence as well. That day, we once again saw how many people could be driven outside the boundaries of citizenship defined by greed and discrimination. We can never accept as president someone who threatened the public forum of democratic society with force, far from breaking down such boundaries to create a society where everyone is dignified. Yoon Suk-yeol must promptly take responsibility for his vain judgment and atone to the people. Furthermore, despite being appointed as a servant of the people but treating that duty lightly, he must accept the people's demands and immediately step down." (QIS)

"The Yoon Suk-yeol government has emphasized the pledge to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family since the election period, and currently the Minister of Gender Equality and Family position has been vacant for 10 months. Thus, the Yoon Suk-yeol government was born by actively utilizing misogyny, and during its term has also caused regression in gender equality policies created together by civil society through cuts in violence prevention against women and gender equality budgets and personnel manipulation. Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law that is unconstitutional and illegal in both content and procedure, announcing his intention to destroy the human rights and democracy of all citizens, which cannot be separated from the attitude of the Yoon Suk-yeol government that has habitually violated women's human rights. For women's human rights and furthermore all people's human rights, Yoon Suk-yeol must step down." (Dal)

"Seoul National University's disability rights club With:D exists to promote disability rights on campus according to its constitution, but this is not a statement that clearly draws boundaries between disabled and non-disabled people to exclude non-disabled people's human rights. With:D has the responsibility to promote the human rights of all campus members regardless of disability, and human rights at this time are also obligations that everyone must enjoy. However, the current president has recently shown a series of actions that lack even basic awareness of human rights. Through emergency martial law, he attempted to use force to block the right to proper political association or protest, and we condemn the current regime that represents the senseless act of reducing the voices of citizens aspiring to a free and equal society to system subversion forces as rebuilding the liberal democratic system." (With:D)

"This is the Yoon Suk-yeol regime that has blocked even proper mourning of preventable social deaths, branded disabled people's rightful demands for citizenship as violent profit-seeking, denied the past, destroyed the environment, and corroded the present. Against the oppression that tries to gag our eyes and mouths with martial law and take away even our grief and future, we who cannot possibly be one but are diverse resist by joining forces from our respective positions. While acknowledging differences in ideology or beliefs, we simultaneously cry out with different voices. Stop seizing power through discrimination and violence. Yoon Suk-yeol must step down." (THISABLE)

We will reclaim the freedom and democracy achieved by citizens against the regime that oppresses civil society. The Yoon Suk-yeol regime that speaks of "anti-state forces" is itself the anti-state force. The Yoon Suk-yeol regime and those who shielded him have shaken democracy and threatened human rights, and for their own interests have fragmented this society by excluding workers, disabled people, women, sexual minorities, and countless other beings. However, people are not fragmented as you want. They do not remain silent as you want either.

We cry out together with all the struggling, excluded, disagreeing, and subversive people:

**"Yoon Suk-yeol, who threatened democracy and human rights with unconstitutional martial law declaration, must step down immediately!"**

        desc: `The 41st Central Steering Committee of Sejong University condemns the emergency martial law declared by President Yoon Seok-yeol on Tuesday, December 3, at around 23:00.

President Yoon's emergency martial law is both substantively and procedurally illegal.

The mobilization of martial law forces to enter the National Assembly and control the rally to pass a resolution to lift martial law is a gross disregard for legislative authority, in violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, and is contrary to the President's stated goal of maintaining constitutional order. According to the Constitution, the declaration of martial law must be deliberated by the Cabinet and notified to the National Assembly without delay, but the emergency martial law is an illegal order that violates this procedure.

The subsequent Decree No. 1 issued by the martial law forces severely restricted the fundamental rights of the Korean people.

Martial law restricts people's fundamental rights and is only allowed as a last resort under the Constitution as it is a national emergency measure that takes over executive and judicial power. President Yoon's reasons for imposing martial law are not constitutionally based on wartime or other national emergencies, but appear to be an abuse of power and an undemocratic order to prevent a political situation.

President Yun should deeply consider and apologize for this threatening emergency martial law, which has diminished the country's status and does not guarantee the protection of South Koreans.

President Yun should clearly recognize and listen to the voices of future generations, which are not political opinions, but the voices of the national emergency created by his undemocratic order.

We, the Central Governing Board of Sejong University, which promotes the growth of the Republic of Korea in accordance with the holy will of the great sages who exalted the honor of the nation, will continue the living history of Korean education based on democratic aspirations while conducting a brilliant and free search for truth for progressive development.

        Today, our reality is facing a major crisis of democratic regression. On December 3, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared emergency martial law in an emergency speech, saying that he would “crush the Jongno forces and maintain a free and constitutional order.” This is an unconstitutional and illegal act, both procedurally and legally, and it is the destruction and retrogression of democracy that has been achieved over the past 70 years.
        
        According to Article 77 (1) and (4) of the Constitution and Article 4 (1) of the Martial Law Act, martial law can only be declared under strict criteria to maintain national security and public order, and when martial law is declared, the president must notify the National Assembly without delay. Martial law after 45 years is a serious challenge to democracy that fails to fulfill its procedural and substantive requirements. During the three hours of emergency martial law, armed troops suppressed the National Assembly, military helicopters hovered over the city center, and other scenes that are unimaginable to us in the 21st century. In addition to the anxiety experienced by the people, South Korea has suffered serious and profound internal injuries to its politics, economy, and diplomacy, and its international credibility.
        
        What values did Yun Suk-yul's government uphold, even as it threatened the safety of its citizens and diminished the country's prestige? Why did the president declare martial law, violating the constitution's guarantee of fundamental rights and the separation of powers? What were the underlying reasons for the country's destiny to become a wind tunnel of totalitarianism?
        What is the underlying reason for this? We condemn the anti-democratic actions of President Yoon Seok-yul, who has committed an act of rebellion by declaring an unconstitutional and illegal emergency martial law. The abuse of power that trampled on democracy and paralyzed the country's government can never be justified.
        
        Sookmyung Women's University is the first ethnic women's institution in Korea, established by the Korean imperial family to save and modernize the country. We, Sookmyung, have constantly kept the flame of resistance burning in response to national crises. In keeping with the spirit of the past, in 2016, Woosooknam became the first university in the country to declare an alliance leave of absence to help rebuild democracy.
        
        Today, our destiny is to be the place to overcome the national crisis and realize a democratic society. As the only university in Yongsan, we will fulfill our social vocation and call. We will walk in the footsteps of our predecessors, who were at the forefront of democratization and led the way forward. We, as young people and university students, will continue our slow but steady steps to make a difference for the future of Korea. We will fulfill our social responsibilities as democratic citizens, which we have learned from Sookmyung, and we will build the land on which we will stand.
        
        The blue flame that blooms in Sookmyung today will illuminate the darkness that threatens to engulf the freedom and democracy of this land, and its flame will become the hottest torch of freedom that defends the Republic of Korea beyond Yongsan Mountain.

The martial law decree, which banned all political activities, including political associations, rallies, and demonstrations, and placed all media and publications under the control of the martial law command, trampled on Korea's liberal democracy and plundered people's freedoms and rights. It undermined and suppressed the essence of the university, which is supposed to be a forum for debate, truth-seeking, and scholarship.
The lack of any notification to the National Assembly, the heart of democracy, regarding the imposition of martial law, and the attempted armed takeover of the country by using soldiers tasked with defending the homeland, are clearly unjust and an anti-democratic abuse of power. We are appalled by this arbitrary and illegal act, which is a disruption of social order and is completely unacceptable.

We, Sungsil, who led the national movement against Japanese colonial rule, refused to visit shrines, and voluntarily abandoned religion in 1938, inherit the spirit of Sungsil, which refuses to succumb to injustice and injustice, including Colonel Kim Chang-seop, who participated in the April 19 Revolution and was martyred, and Colonel Park Rae-jeon, who sacrificed his life for democracy.

We strongly condemn the anti-democratic declaration of emergency martial law by Yoon Seok-yeol.
We demand that Yoon Seok-yeol, the president who undermined the liberal democracy of Korea, be held accountable. One, we will defend liberal democracy with the spirit of sincerity that does not compromise with injustice.
Continuing the proud history of defending the nation against Japanese oppression and dictatorship
we resolve to confront anti-democratic acts in order to defend the liberal democracy of the Republic of Korea.

On December 3, 2024, President Yun Seok-yul declared emergency martial law in an urgent public address, and the martial law forces attempted to seize the National Assembly, the seat of the people's will, and the National Election Commission, which is required to be neutral and independent, violating the basic order of liberal democracy. This is an unprecedented and unconstitutional outrage that must never be repeated since the Sixth Republic's constitutional system began in 1987.

Upon taking office, the president swears an oath to the people to uphold the constitution and protect the country. Despite his oath, President Yun declared martial law in violation of the Constitution, ignoring the procedural and substantive legitimacy required for martial law declarations, and for his own political gain; he did not notify the National Assembly of the declaration of martial law; he issued a proclamation that prevented the National Assembly from meeting; and he suspended the functioning of the National Assembly as a martial law force to prevent the National Assembly from resolving to lift the unconstitutional martial law declaration. In the end, the president grossly violated his promises to the people and directly led the country into a state of civil war.


We, Inha University, as a hall of intellectuals representing Incheon, make the following declaration in accordance with the preamble and Article 26 of the Inha University Central Student Association Constitution, which states that we, as the true owners of Inha University, will resist injustice through a unique and independent student society, and further consolidate our qualities as free and civilized citizens with the mission to lead the prosperity of Korea based on the spirit of truth-seeking, character development, and social service.

Subsequently, Martial Law Proclamation No. 1 was issued by the martial law commander.

Was the current situation mentioned by the President truly a national emergency corresponding to Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea?

We ask whether the emergency martial law declared for the purpose of "eradicating pro-North anti-state forces that engage in impeachment motions against government officials and paralyzing judicial and administrative affairs" and protecting the free constitutional order was truly a choice for the people.

Does martial law that did not go through the procedure of notifying the National Assembly after declaration, as required by Article 77, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, have legal effect?

We ask whether President Yoon Suk-yeol, who caused national chaos with unconstitutional emergency martial law declared without going through proper procedures, is not himself an anti-state actor who manipulated the Constitution.

The President blockaded the National Assembly, the hall of democracy, and mobilized police and military forces to control freedom of press and assembly.

We ask whether such unconstitutional acts were unavoidable measures implemented under the guise of national sustainability for future generations.

This is an extremely unreasonable anti-democratic action that collapses the democratic foundation of the Republic of Korea and extinguishes the torch of freedom.

As student representatives constituting the university community, we strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law, which threatens our safety and daily life by collapsing the cradle of free academic inquiry and pursuit of truth through the issuance of proclamations.

On April 19, 1960, Chung-Ang University led the struggle toward freedom by crying out the spirit of "die for righteousness and live for truth."

Our Chung-Ang University cries out in anger at the deplorable reality that brutally tramples liberal democracy:

"No individual in the Republic of Korea should damage the Constitution and democratic values."

The blood and spirit of senior spirits shed to overthrow the dictatorial regime are embedded in the life of Chung-Ang University under the slogan of "Righteous Blood Chung-Ang."

Chung-Ang University in 2024, inheriting the spirit of righteousness and truth, resolves to resist President Yoon Suk-yeol's anti-democratic behavior that violates the Constitution in order to lead in implementing national and social justice.

The President's declaration of emergency martial law violates the Constitution and laws in all aspects, including its requirements and procedures. Is the Republic of Korea currently in a state of war or a similar national emergency, or is it necessary to mobilize the armed forces to maintain public order?

If there is a national emergency, such as wartime or a catastrophic event, and the government has no choice but to hide it, the declaration of emergency martial law may be justified. However, the President's reasons for declaring emergency martial law do not fulfill the requirements for the establishment of a system as stipulated by the Constitution and laws.

In addition, after declaring emergency martial law, the president failed to notify the National Assembly, ignoring the constitutional provision that the president must immediately notify the National Assembly, and the martial law command banned all political activities, including demonstrations and rallies, including the activities of the National Assembly and political parties. The declaration of emergency martial law, which sought to prevent the National Assembly from working, the only constitutional way to lift martial law, was a clear violation of the Constitution and laws, both procedurally and substantively.

Article 1(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea declares that “the sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people, and all power comes from the people.” The people are the sole authority in the Republic of Korea. The president only exercises the power delegated by the people for a limited period of time. It is unacceptable for the president to trample on the fundamental rights of the people and liberal democracy with the power he is supposed to use for the people.

We condemn President Yoon Seok-yeol for violating the Constitution's duty to uphold the Constitution, trampling on the fundamental rights of the people and threatening their lives by declaring emergency martial law.

Watching democracy crumble, we cannot help but ask:

On December 3, 2024, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared emergency martial law. Helicopter sounds echoed through the city center, and airborne troops broke National Assembly windows and stormed into the building. People asked about each other's safety, some heading home, others toward the National Assembly. In December 2024, when events we had only seen in history textbooks unfolded before our eyes, who are the anti-state forces that destroyed the constitutional order?

There should be no shameful history where a president who declared unconstitutional emergency martial law bears no responsibility.

As prospective teachers who will be responsible for elementary education in the future, we cannot remain silent about President Yoon Seok-yeol's unconstitutional and arbitrary actions. So that when we stand at the podium in the future, we will not have to teach the shameful history of a president who declared unconstitutional emergency martial law and bore no responsibility, we will do what we can now.

Prospective teachers will take the lead in creating a page in history textbooks.

Prospective teachers have led the way in protecting democracy more than anyone else to become teachers who are not ashamed before children. The democracy protected by the blood and sweat of countless democratic martyrs from education universities, including Seoul National University of Education's Park Seon-young and Gwangju National University of Education's Lee Kyung-dong and Han Sang-yong martyrs, collapsed in an instant. Now it is time for us to make history. Pre-service teachers will take the lead in showing that the people are the masters of the state and that the Republic of Korea's power comes from the people.

When we change, education changes,
When education changes, the world changes.

Let us prospective teachers gather to remove darkness and change the world.

        desc: `On the night of December 3, 2024, President Yoon Seok-yeol witnessed the brutal trampling of the Republic of Korea's democracy, achieved through the blood and sweat of our predecessors, through martial law for the first time in 45 years since the dictatorship.

Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution: "The President may declare martial law in accordance with the provisions of law when it is necessary to respond to military needs with military force or to maintain public peace and order in wartime, civil war, or equivalent national emergency situations."

Was it truly a national emergency situation warranting the declaration of emergency martial law for the first time in half a century?

The proclamation announced following the emergency martial law declaration prohibits all political activities including the activities of the National Assembly and local councils, political parties, political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations. All media and publications are subject to control by the martial law command.

Who are the real anti-state forces? President Yoon Seok-yeol and his accomplices, who damaged the constitutional order through the declaration of emergency martial law in violation of the Constitution and laws, mobilized the military and police—who should be loyal to the state and people and protect liberal democracy—to block lawmakers gathering to lift emergency martial law, control citizens, and ordered martial law troops to enter the National Assembly with guns, breaking windows and disrupting efforts to protect democracy.

As future generations who cultivate humanity's intellectual horizons with realistic learning as the foundation of teaching and learning, if the foundation of the Republic of Korea's democracy is destroyed and voices of freedom are silenced, we will resist to the end and cry out to the end to protect the democracy of free Korea.

There should be no more shameful history in the history of free Korea.
We demand the immediate resignation of President Yoon Seok-yeol and related parties.

At 22:23 on December 3, 2024, President Yoon Seok-yeol announced through a national address that he would declare emergency martial law to eliminate anti-state forces.
President Yoon Seok-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law is an act that damages constitutional order, lacking justification and procedural legitimacy, and does not conform to the basic principles of the Constitution and rule of law. This is a serious matter that shakes the foundation of democracy.

This emergency martial law declaration by President Yoon Seok-yeol lacks justification. According to Article 77 of the Constitution, emergency martial law is only permitted restrictively during wartime, civil war, or equivalent national crisis situations.

However, around 22:00 on December 3, was the Republic of Korea in an extremely chaotic situation? Was it wartime, civil war, or an equivalent emergency situation? The vague "elimination of anti-state forces" mentioned in President Yoon's address cannot serve as grounds for restricting citizens' basic rights.

This emergency martial law declaration by President Yoon violated the principles of rule of law. According to Articles 4 and 13 of the Martial Law Act, when declaring martial law, the National Assembly must be notified without delay, and when in recess, the National Assembly must be requested to convene, and lawmakers' privilege against arrest must be maintained. That is, even under martial law, the National Assembly's functions are guaranteed and legislative activities must be protected even under martial law. There is no legal basis in the law to restrict the legislature's actions.

Nevertheless, the proclamation prohibited all political activities of the National Assembly and local councils and attempted to arrest lawmakers by deploying soldiers to the National Assembly. The proclamation is a subordinate order to the Martial Law Act based on the Constitution, and this is clearly a violation of superior laws. The lawyer-turned-president damaged constitutional order and the basic principles of rule of law.

[We cannot tolerate the arrogance of power that threatens democracy.]
The emergency martial law incident after 44 years is an irrational and anti-democratic behavior by the President of the Republic of Korea that ignores democracy and violates the principles of rule of law. What could be more important than protecting the people's freedom, democracy, and the values of rule of law?

[We ask.]
Even amid continuous crises and instability, citizens' basic rights must be protected. Was this country's situation truly an extreme crisis requiring emergency martial law? Was this measure a choice for the people's safety and freedom, or a decision to strengthen power?

[True light will ultimately illuminate darkness.]
This emergency martial law declaration will remain as a serious matter that damages constitutional values and shakes the foundation of the Republic of Korea's democracy. We demand a clear explanation, apology, and responsible measures from President Yoon Seok-yeol for this act that restricted the people's freedom and rights.
Our voice is the voice of young people who pursue learning under the value of true light, acquire wisdom, and dream of a better tomorrow for the Republic of Korea. We will proceed to the end to protect the Republic of Korea's democracy and freedom values under the truth of true light. With the belief of true light that does not succumb to oppression, we will definitely protect democracy and rule of law.

Democracy, defended by the precious lives of the people, cannot be damaged by any power. We cannot accept President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law and strongly condemn it.
On December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared that he "declared martial law with resolute determination to save the nation against anti-state forces that paralyze the essential functions of the state and seek to collapse the constitutional order of liberal democracy." What are these anti-state forces that paralyze state functions and seek to collapse the constitutional order of liberal democracy? Have you forgotten the history of the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement and the democratic struggles against dictatorship?

Is not the illegal declaration of martial law a clear anti-state act that seriously damages the constitutional order of the free Republic of Korea, disrupts legitimate state institutions established according to the Constitution and laws, and plots rebellion? Are you not truly the anti-state force that paralyzes state functions and seeks to collapse the constitutional order of liberal democracy?

The people express serious anger beyond shock and dismay. Does President Yoon Suk-yeol, despite being in the presidency through democratic voting rights, have no shame? He should immediately acknowledge responsibility for damaging the history of democracy and liberation, sincerely apologize before the people, and receive proper judgment.

As citizens of the Republic of Korea, we must defend our "democratic" nation. We must continuously raise our voices and take action. We must fight against all forms of oppression and injustice and unite our solidarity. Our voices will never be scattered, and we will fulfill our responsibility as descendants of democratic history.

We can no longer remain silent. We will rise together. There should never again be suffering of the people in the Republic of Korea. Do not threaten the precious lives of the people any longer.

        desc: `On December 3, 2024, democracy in the Republic of Korea was brutally trampled upon. President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law is a heinous act that betrayed the Constitution and the people. The attempt to suppress people's freedom in the name of martial law and destroy democracy using power as a weapon is absolutely unacceptable. This is a clear act of national rebellion that defines the people as enemies and destroys constitutional order.
This martial law was carried out solely to avoid a political crisis, lacking constitutional basis and legitimacy. It was not an emergency measure to solve the crisis facing the nation, but rather the president using his power to threaten the people in order to suppress political opposition forces.
We do not consider this incident merely a political mistake or error in judgment. This is a thoroughly planned and deliberately carried out act of destroying constitutional order. Although the National Assembly quickly neutralized martial law, the attempt by martial law forces to invade the National Assembly in the process was direct violence against democracy. The act of physically pressuring the people's representative institution and attempting to neutralize the legislature can itself be called national treason.

President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law declaration was solely to achieve his political purposes, and we will never forgive this.

Art is based on freedom and creativity and cannot exist in an oppressed society. However, people's oppression and dictatorship like martial law eliminate freedom of expression and constitute violence against art. Art is the power to resist oppression and fight against injustice. The student government of Kaywon University of Art & Design pledges to reflect once again on the essence and role of art through this incident and to fight to defend the values of democracy and freedom.

President Yoon Suk-yeol and the government must take full responsibility for this incident. The presidency is public authority based on people's trust, not a tool to wield power to cover personal wrongdoings. Acts that violated the Constitution and threatened the people can never be overlooked. President Yoon Suk-yeol must apologize to the people immediately and step down from all public offices. Furthermore, all those involved in leading this incident must receive legal judgment through thorough investigation.

We strongly urge the following demands:
First, President Yoon Suk-yeol must resign immediately
The president must take responsibility for betraying the people and threatening democracy and step down immediately.
Second, punish all those responsible for martial law declaration
Clearly identify all those who planned and executed martial law and subject them to legal judgment.
Third, establish measures to prevent recurrence for defending democracy
Establish institutional mechanisms to prevent abuse of emergency measures and thoroughly protect people's basic rights and constitutional order.

The spirit of the April 19 Revolution, May 18 Democratization Movement, and June Struggle still lives on in the people of the Republic of Korea. Our Kaywon University of Art & Design student government will also not compromise with injustice through action. Democracy is our non-negotiable value and the foundation of our lives. The Yoon Suk-yeol regime's tyranny will surely receive history's judgment, and we will not stop taking action for this.
The student government of Kaywon University of Art & Design will fight against all attempts to violate democracy and freedom. Our voices will never be broken, and art will always stand on the side of truth and freedom.

This is an unprecedented incident that is hard to believe occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2024, which nurtures democratic procedures and freedom.

President Yoon Suk-yeol caused anxiety among all citizens through the extreme method of nighttime martial law to avoid legitimate public demands and criticism. What exactly is the liberal democracy that President Yoon Suk-yeol claimed? The president abused military force to blockade the National Assembly representing the people's will and made us witness the collapse of the constitutional order of the free Republic of Korea through proclamations that suppress people's basic rights. Is this the reality of the liberal democracy he speaks of? Furthermore, did he feel no shame in corrupting national sovereignty and rule of law by reducing martial law to merely a political tool?

The Kookmin University Student Council Emergency Committee strongly condemns President Yoon Suk-yeol for recreating painful history that should not be repeated and inflicting national trauma. Democracy, protected by the blood and sweat of the people in the past, is the legitimacy of the Republic of Korea, and its dignified value must not be damaged. Remember that any act contrary to the democratic spirit of the Republic of Korea cannot escape the people's anger and judgment.

The preamble to the Kookmin University Student Council Constitution states that our university's mission lies in the pursuit of truth and defense of freedom, and we must resolutely resist external forces that seek to sever this. Therefore, as student representatives constituting the Kookmin University student community, we feel devastated about this series of incidents and wish to lead in protecting the rights of 15,000 independent Bukak students.
The democracy we seek to protect does not simply mean just a system. As Kookmin University members inheriting the spirit of Haegong Shin Ik-hee and Seonggok Kim Seong-gon, who are the roots of our university, this is a struggle to secure the right for the next generation to live in a free and democratic Republic of Korea.

The Kookmin University Student Council Emergency Committee, marching forward with the shouts of liberation, will resist to the end to establish the values of liberal democracy despite President Yoon Suk-yeol's unreasonable tyranny.

        desc: `We condemn President Yoon Seok-yul's Declaration of Emergency Martial Law on December 3rd.

On Tuesday, December 3, 2024, the Republic of Korea, a country with a rich history and tradition, faced an unacceptable moment when its liberal and democratic basic order was undermined. At 22:25 on December 3, the President of the Republic of Korea, Yun Seok-yul, declared 'emergency martial law' as the head of state, and at 23:00 on the same day, the martial law commander promulgated the Pogo Decree No. 1. Martial law allows the president to severely restrict people's freedom through the exercise of power, and the scope of the restrictions is wide-ranging. President Yoon Seok-yeol has issued an order that seriously undermines the principle of separation of powers, and the order is unacceptable for any reason, as it significantly threatens the value of freedom implied by the separation of powers. As such, we, the 51st Myongji University Humanities and Natural Sciences Campus Steering Committee, strongly demand a full and reasonable accountability for his decision, which is hard to find room for sympathy as a free citizen of Korea.

Myongji University is a comprehensive university in South Korea that pursues academic freedom. The declaration of emergency martial law and the mobilization of police and military force to control the functioning of certain constitutional institutions are completely unacceptable, even from an academic point of view. The fact that one side of the constitutional government tried to make the other side uncontrollable is a violation of the basic order of liberal democracy, and the helplessness that academics felt that night in the face of power is indescribable. Academic freedom is a right guaranteed by the Constitution. As a member of a comprehensive university, it is shocking to realize that the defense of academic freedom has led to the loss of the function of a constitutional institution. The numerous academic achievements, contributions to society, and academic values that have been considered the golden rule of Korean academia have been completely destroyed since that night. In other words, Korea's liberal democracy, which was built on academic freedom, was denied in an instant. We cannot help but be dismayed by the fact that the pain and hard work of scholars up to this point has been dismissed by a single person in power.
The president of South Korea has the duty to defend the constitution. Any president who commits an unconstitutional act must be held accountable. The grounds for extra-constitutional behavior are as follows.

First, the constitutional institutions other than the president are defined as enemies, and this is called a national emergency.
Second, it mobilized police and military forces against specific constitutional institutions with direct legitimacy.
Third, it cannot be concluded that the state of emergency cannot be overcome without the use of military force.

President Yoon's extra-constitutional actions not only seriously undermined the constitutional order of a liberal democracy, but also damaged Korea's academic reputation to a significant extent. The Central Steering Committee of the 51st Myongji University Humanities and Natural Sciences Campus speaks to President Yoon Seok-yeol. We once again strongly demand that you take full and proper responsibility for degrading the liberal democratic constitutional order on which Korea's existence has been firmly built and the academic values that have developed under the foundation of freedom.

As representatives of students and members of a national university, Seoul National University of Science and Technology Student Council has the duty to maintain political neutrality and protect students' democratic autonomous activities and their rights.

The martial law declared by President Yoon Suk-yeol on December 3, 2024, prohibited all political activities including the activities of the National Assembly and local councils, political parties, political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations. While it prohibited the denial of the liberal democratic system, President Yoon Suk-yeol actually controlled media and publications, taking away and suppressing the voices of the nation and people who pursue truth.
The Constitution of the Republic of Korea is based on the fundamental principles of democracy, rule of law, and human rights protection. Article 76 of the Constitution stipulates the conditions and procedures under which the president can declare a state of emergency. However, such measures must respect legal grounds and people's rights, and according to Articles 21 and 37 of the Constitution, while basic rights may be restricted under martial law, such restrictions must be minimal and based on law.

The declaration of martial law, which lacked procedural legitimacy and violated constitutional values and basic rights, can be considered an act that created social unrest. We Euui people have no shame before the name of national independence (民族自主) that we have been shouting for, so we declare that such actions by President Yoon Suk-yeol "cannot be justified as anti-democratic acts that suppress the freedom of not only all students of Seoul National University of Science and Technology pursuing national independence, but all citizens."
As the Seoul National University of Science and Technology Central Executive Committee represents the opinions of all students, we have carefully considered expressing our opinion on the current situation, considering political and activist issues that may arise at our university in the future.

However, because the history of truth we have pursued will not betray our will, and because we know that the proof of our will to enlighten the world despite countless suppressions has not yet been extinguished, we condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, which insulted those who defended constitutional order with individual will.

Following President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, political activities including the activities of the National Assembly and local councils, political parties, political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations were prohibited, and freedom of media and publication were also deprived in an instant.

According to Article 77, Paragraphs 1 and 4 of the Constitution and Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Martial Law Act, martial law can only be declared under strict standards to ensure national security and maintain public order. The illegal act of declaring martial law without meeting any procedures and requirements trampled on the history and values of democracy that our country has protected with countless blood and sweat.

The president, as a representative of a nation, should protect the safety of the people and enhance the nation's status. However, President Yoon declared anti-democratic martial law in the Republic of Korea, a democratic nation, causing anxiety among the people and abandoning trust and support as the representative of the Republic of Korea.

Here we want to ask: What exactly did President Yoon seek to protect by taking the people's safety hostage and shaking the nation's security and economy? Who are the real anti-state forces that are plundering the people's rights and freedom?

This martial law, enforced by violating the basic rights of the people guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and ignoring democratic procedures, is an unacceptable action and an act that damaged the fundamental values of the Constitution and liberal democracy that we have protected for decades, regardless of any political ideology.

As citizens of the Republic of Korea, we must fight against the irrationality that harms the people and the nation. The just and noble national character of the people of the Republic of Korea, which still remains boldly, has directly protected the hope of the nation, and with that hope, we were finally able to correct the history of democracy.

We all clearly remember the history from 45 years ago, and we must unite and raise our voices to ensure that such wrong acts are never repeated.

In his martial law address, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law throughout the Republic of Korea, citing the need to "eradicate the anti-state forces that are the source of national ruin and engage in evil acts."

We ask President Yoon Suk-yeol: Who exactly are the "anti-state forces" that have been mentioned several times whenever facing unfavorable situations, and what is the basis for this judgment? On the night martial law was declared, President Yoon Suk-yeol should know that the "monster that seeks to collapse the liberal democratic system" he mentioned is none other than President Yoon Suk-yeol himself.

We are angry. There are no people among those President Yoon Suk-yeol seeks to protect.
We, Seoul Women's University students who have transcended ourselves and united, strongly cry out.

Article 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea: The Republic of Korea is a democratic republic. The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people, and all power comes from the people. President Yoon Suk-yeol has mercilessly trampled and damaged our Constitution, which contains the spirit of democratic reform.

Prove before the people whether the declaration of martial law is proper democracy. We are deeply angry at the absurd and tragic commotion in democratic history that occurred in the middle of the night, and we hope that we can deliver severe judgment with our own hands.
We will never forget the act of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who should protect the people's rights, pointing guns by mobilizing military force during the people's peaceful night.

Martial law after 44 years. Anti-constitutional, anti-democratic acts. International disgrace and dishonor. President Yoon Suk-yeol, who denied the fundamentals of democracy and made people who cannot forget the painful history of the past tremble with fear. Is the shameless attitude of claiming no wrongdoing truly democracy of the people, by the people, for the people? We condemn this clear act of dictatorship.

As intellectuals living in this era, we will shout and hold up hot candles until President Yoon Suk-yeol, who betrayed the people, and the members who cooperated with him receive proper judgment.

Once again, we will light candles and share this cold winter together.
With the approval of 190 National Assembly members, President Yoon Suk-yeol's surprise martial law came to an end after 6 hours. Even if martial law forces occupied the National Assembly and trampled people's freedom through proclamations, our righteous movement toward liberal democracy does not stop.

One candle that showed courage despite fear will become a huge spark and create a brighter democracy.

We are stronger than I am. In December, we once again light candles to defend our rights.

How many lives were destroyed by the regime of Yoon Seok-yeol, a despicable man who never showed any remorse or responsibility for the Itaewon tragedy. Their shameless disregard for the Special Prosecutor Act. Their cowardly silence about their own irregularities and corruption.

Let us leave behind the shameful days when we bowed our heads in fear and raise the flagpole for the future of democracy. Let us sing joyfully in the coming spring.

According to Article 77(1) of the Constitution, martial law can be declared as prescribed by law in times of war or national emergency. However, at the time of the martial law declaration, Korea was not in a wartime-like emergency, but rather faced an emergency in which democracy was undermined by President Yun's declaration of martial law. President Yoon's use of martial law as a tyrannical means of maintaining power rather than responding to a national crisis will not escape the judgment of history.

When declaring a state of emergency, the National Assembly must be notified without delay. However, President Yun blocked the National Assembly, and his actions were tyrannical and disrespectful of the Korean Constitution. As the head of state who is supposed to defend democracy, Yun abused his power, and what is he standing for?

For about 150 minutes, all Koreans were forced to witness before their eyes the disastrous reality of a democracy where freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association were trampled upon. This destructive and dictatorial behavior, which shook the foundations of democracy by promoting fear and unrest, is absolutely unacceptable from a president who is supposed to protect and promote the freedom and welfare of the people.

Article 1 of the Martial Law Decree No. 1, which ignored the fundamental freedoms and rights of the people as set forth in the Preamble to the Constitution and Article 37(1) of the Constitution through Articles 1, 3, and 4, and restricted the National Assembly, the sanctuary of democracy, is a clearly unconstitutional and tyrannical idea that has not been included in any decree under any circumstances in the past military dictatorships.

Martial law forces were deployed to suppress the democratic actions of the National Assembly members, the people's representatives, on lifting martial law, which were broadcast to the entire country and the world. The declaration of martial law and the proclamation of a state of emergency did not resonate with the people, resulting in heightened public unrest, global embarrassment, and economic instability.

The declaration of martial law is more than just a political decision, it is an act that is absolutely unacceptable in the current situation in Korea and tramples on the liberal democratic system of Korea.

We remember the struggle for the democratization of the university in 1986 and the blood shed in the May 3 Incheon Democratic Uprising. On behalf of Incheon Metropolitan University, we remember the cornerstone of social democratization, the history of driving out the corrupt academy and turning it into a city university.

As a vanguard against injustice and the beginning of the democratization of Incheon, the Incheon National University Student Association will defend the freedom that is the core value of the university under any circumstances.

        desc: `On December 3, 2024, the people spent the night in fear and chaos.
The President ultimately trampled upon the democracy that our people and martyred predecessors had protected with their blood and lives through his unilateral and unconstitutional illegal declaration. No matter how hard we look, the fairness and common sense that the President had so loudly proclaimed simply did not exist.

He declared that he "proclaimed emergency martial law to protect the free Republic of Korea from threats by North Korean communist forces and to completely eradicate the shameless pro-North anti-state forces that are robbing our people of their freedom and happiness, and to protect the free constitutional order."

If so:
What kind of nation is the free Republic of Korea you speak of?
What are the freedom and happiness of our people that you speak of?
What are the shameless anti-state forces you speak of, and who is the one violating the free constitutional order?

Answer us, Yoon Suk-yeol!
This is a regime that has completely collapsed both morally and legally. Their decision, which directly copied the typical methods of dictatorial regimes from decades ago, leaves no room for democracy. A regime that destroys constitutional order and points guns at the people has no legitimacy.

In accordance with the basic principles of liberal democracy, as of December 3rd, we, the people, command President Yoon Suk-yeol and his subordinates, who have damaged the values of the free Republic of Korea, oppressed the freedom and happiness of the people, and as shameless anti-state forces caused internal rebellion and destroyed the free constitutional order: Resign immediately!

Jeju holds a history of struggle stained with blood due to the April 3rd incident, the pinnacle of unjust public power and extreme brutality. Our predecessor student councils fought to protect the values of democracy granted by popular sovereignty and to reveal the truth about Jeju 4·3, the bloodstain of state violence. That is the reason we stand here today.

We inherit the history of resistance, and the southern provinces do not sleep. As descendants of 4·3, just as our predecessors fought to defend democracy amid countless oppression and suppression, we will mobilize all possible means - resignation, abdication, impeachment - to normalize the Republic of Korea and fight to protect Korea's democracy.

As the minimum conscience of our era taking action, as the final bastion of democracy, as the organized power of awakened citizens, we rise resolutely, take to the streets, and cry out:
One, We strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law that damaged democratic values.
Two, We will protect democracy under any suppression.
Three, For the unconstitutional martial law declaration, President Yoon Suk-yeol must resign immediately.
Four, The National Assembly must respond to the people with only the result of impeachment approval in the impeachment vote scheduled for the 7th.

        desc: `Hallym University has pursued truth and freedom as its founding ideals, contributing to social justice and human happiness through academics and culture. This spirit has been embodied through the autonomous and independent role of university members in the history of democratization movements, including the June Democratic Uprising.

However, today we face a situation that threatens democracy from its very foundation. On December 3rd, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law under the pretext of "completely eradicating the shameless pro-North anti-state forces that are robbing our people of their freedom and happiness and protecting the free constitutional order." Despite not meeting any requirements for martial law, he abused the presidential emergency power of martial law declaration, which is granted for unavoidable cases in preparation for national emergencies.
What exactly is the free constitutional order that President Yoon Suk-yeol speaks of?

The emergency martial law declared through absolute power exercise made all citizens tremble in anxiety. This is clearly a dictatorial act that denies the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution and shakes the foundation of democracy. It is an act that tramples upon the democratic spirit that our predecessors protected with their lives, and as university members who love social justice and freedom, we cannot overlook this matter.

We seek to fulfill the university's inherent function by inheriting Hallym University's ideals and spirit in this crisis situation. Universities have the responsibility to remain independent from improper government intervention, protect truth and freedom, and fulfill social responsibility.

Therefore, we strongly condemn the declaration of emergency martial law and clarify our position as follows:
1. The Yoon Suk-yeol regime must take responsibility for the current situation.
The Yoon Suk-yeol regime, which has completely lost trust, must take responsibility for this incident to the end and immediately implement concrete and substantial measures to restore democracy and constitutional order. We will strongly resist until the regime responds to this.
2. We urge the restoration of democratic values and rule of law.
President Yoon Suk-yeol and the government must listen to the people's will and take the lead in restoring the values of democracy and rule of law that they have trampled. We will stand in solidarity to protect university freedom and autonomy and practice the spirit of Hallym University that pursues truth and freedom.

The Hallym University Student Council and Central Executive Committee declare that we will fight to the end with the united strength and will of all members to protect democracy and revive the true university spirit that contributes to the development of the nation and humanity.

        desc: `Since President Yoon Suk-yeol took office proclaiming "values of freedom, human rights, fairness, and solidarity," democracy in our society has been regressing. Only two and a half years after taking office, many citizens are again holding candlelight vigils and calling for his resignation. Why are people holding candles again at the threshold of winter?

For the past two and a half years, the Republic of Korea has been operating in what amounts to anarchy. Even at the scene of the Itaewon tragedy where many citizens lost their lives, even in the struggles of shipyard workers who locked themselves in prison cells fighting because they couldn't live like this anymore, even in the flooded underpass, we could not find the President. Even in the reality where both self-employed business owners and workers live difficult lives due to accelerating economic polarization, where freedom of press and expression guaranteed by the Constitution are being suppressed, and discrimination and hatred against the weak and minorities reach their peak, the President's presence is invisible. Even by the river where a marine soldier lost his life due to wrong orders, even at the high-altitude protest site where a female worker is fighting in the sky, the President remains absent. What was President Yoon Suk-yeol doing during the time when society was stained with social disasters and hatred against the weak and minorities?

Even now, as war crisis escalates on the Korean Peninsula, President Yoon is provoking neighboring countries by proceeding with unconstitutional troop deployments. While the lives of self-employed business owners and workers are becoming impoverished due to economic crisis, he is driving livelihood to the edge of a cliff through abolishing financial investment income tax and tax cuts for the rich. Turning our attention to medical fields, people's health and lives are still threatened by the aftermath of the medical crisis, and citizens feel shame and humiliation due to the appointment of New Right figures and humiliating Korea-Japan diplomacy. Meanwhile, President Yoon does not acknowledge his ignorance, and the situation of dividing the nation using ideology as a standard continues.

On the night of December 3rd, he finally "declared emergency martial law." He said it was "to protect the free Republic of Korea from threats by North Korean communist forces and completely eradicate the shameless pro-North anti-state forces that are robbing our people of their freedom and happiness, and to protect the free constitutional order." People were stunned, wondering what era we are living in. The Yoon Suk-yeol government, which has been consistent only with color theory and hostile North Korean perspectives, continues to blame others and reveal incompetence and ignorance even at this moment. And they committed irreversible atrocities such as pointing guns at sovereign citizens and armed soldiers entering the National Assembly. Although last night's disturbance was settled through efforts by the National Assembly and citizens, the process of bringing down the Yoon Suk-yeol government and clearly correcting the unconstitutional behavior of the current government that we witnessed last night still remains.

Now is the time to act.
During the time when the government exercised veto power 24 times against National Assembly decisions, while the government bankrupted the national treasury with tax cuts for the rich under the pretext of fiscal soundness and worried about household debt exceeding 1,900 trillion won, during all the time when labor law amendments to protect workers' minimum rights were blocked - we should not have endured all this. Now is the time to speak firmly. We must bring down and investigate and punish President Yoon Suk-yeol and government officials, especially those who led this "emergency martial law."

We will no longer overlook this dismal reality.
Inheriting the fighting tradition of Hanshin University, which led the fight for democracy, and the spirit of martyrs who did not yield to injustice, we will judge the Yoon Suk-yeol government that creates an era of regression. In the name of all Hanshin students, graduates, and everyone associated with Hanshin, we once again solemnly urge the resignation of the Yoon Suk-yeol government.

        desc: `President Yoon Suk-yeol declared unconstitutional emergency martial law on December 3, 2024.

It is unconstitutional because, ignoring the full text of Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution which states "The President may proclaim martial law in accordance with the provisions of Act in case of wartime, armed conflict or similar national emergency when it is necessary to cope with a military exigency or to maintain the public safety and order by mobilization of the military forces," he declared emergency martial law despite the absence of wartime, armed conflict, or similar national emergency.

He damaged the values of liberal democracy that our predecessors and democratic martyrs in the 1980s protected and hoped for with their resolve and death.

He blocked access to the National Assembly, the hall of public opinion where people's representatives should meet and decide, threatened them with martial law troops' guns, and had martial law troops illegally occupy the National Assembly building to arrest those with different beliefs from his own.

Democracy is the fundamental value of our society and our final decision that all citizens should enjoy, protected by our people with blood, tears, and death. We will never forget the night of December 3rd when unimaginable events occurred in this democratic Republic of Korea. As Hyupsung University Student Council, we declare that we cannot remain silent to protect democracy.

Therefore, President Yoon Suk-yeol must acknowledge that this emergency martial law was unconstitutional due to his misjudgment and apologize to all citizens. And we urge President Yoon Suk-yeol to be judged according to law for the unconstitutional martial law he ordered.
In the future, Hyupsung University Student Council will resist in alliance with other university student councils that condemn the unconstitutional martial law.

We will resist not with the guns of martial law troops that President Yoon Suk-yeol used, but through democratic and peaceful methods.

The martial law declared again 44 years after the emergency martial law that stained Gwangju with blood in 1980 was an outrage that trampled the basic principles of democracy without even clear justification.

Our Constitution allows martial law declaration only in wartime or similar conflict situations. However, the Republic of Korea on December 3, 2024, was enjoying peaceful daily life. The martial law, disguised as correcting democracy but carried out unilaterally in complete disregard of constitutional procedures - for whom and for what was this measure?

On the night when emergency martial law was declared, Fine Arts students were working late and spent the night in fear, checking on their families' safety. We saw with our own eyes military helicopters flying over our heads toward the National Assembly, the symbol of democracy.
How can the current government, which is at the center of all this chaos, claim to correct democracy! The government's abuse of military command authority for its own interests is very deceptive and unbelievable as a decision by a nation's head of state.

We will never overlook this. The Yoon Suk-yeol government, which tries to rule over the people while excluding them, is democracy's greatest enemy. Today, the 6th, we continue to tremble in fear of the possibility of another emergency martial law being raised. We strongly condemn the Yoon Suk-yeol government's emergency martial law measures that damage democratic values, using the power granted by the people not to protect the people but failing to do so.

        desc: `As intellectuals who embody the spirit of fraternal love (博愛), service (奉仕), and patriotism (愛國), we strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's undemocratic declaration of martial law.

On December 3, 2024, at 22:23, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law through an emergency address from the Yongsan Presidential Office, stating the purpose was to eradicate pro-North Korean forces and anti-state forces and to protect the free constitutional order.

President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law is a clear violation of the Constitution as specified in Article 77 of the Constitution and Articles 4 and 13 of the Martial Law Act. According to the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and the Martial Law Act, "When martial law is declared, the President must immediately notify the National Assembly, and when the National Assembly is in recess, the President must immediately request the National Assembly to convene." However, the President neither notified the National Assembly of the martial law declaration nor requested its convening, declaring martial law that damaged constitutional order and the basic principles of democracy.

On December 3, 2024, at 23:00, the Martial Law Command issued a proclamation. Article 1 of the Martial Law Command's proclamation stated "All political activities including the activities of the National Assembly and local assemblies, political parties, political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations are prohibited." The Martial Law Command showed behavior attempting to seize control of the National Assembly by deploying martial law troops. This is an illegal act for which no legal basis can be found anywhere in the laws of the Republic of Korea, and was a measure of constitutional disorder that attempted to control even the legislative branch's authority, which is the last resort for checking martial law as specified in the Constitution.

As intellectuals who embody the spirit of "fraternal love, service, and patriotism," the educational ideology of Gachon University specified in Chapter 1, Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Gachon University regulations, we will not stand by and watch the damage to the noble spirit and ideology of democracy and the constitutional history of our nation that has struggled to protect democracy from the past to the present.

As stated in Chapter 1, Articles 2 and 6 of the Gachon University Student Council Constitution, we who have the duty to protect Gachon University student rights and defend our members declare:

This martial law incident is a measure of constitutional disorder where the President, who has the duty to uphold justice, damaged the people's freedom and rights, the noble spirit and ideology of democracy, constitutional values, and shook the foundation of the democratic republic.

President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law, which violated the values of liberal democracy, justice, and constitutional order of the Republic of Korea, can never be tolerated.

We strongly resist this irrational and unjust act that distorted and damaged democracy and the rule of law, and promise to struggle to the end to defend the democratic values of the Republic of Korea. We who embody the spirit of Gachon's proud educational ideology of "fraternal love (博愛), service (奉仕), and patriotism (愛國)" hope that the democratic values, freedom, and peace of the Republic of Korea will be protected, and if the freedom and peace of the Republic of Korea are threatened again, we will defend them without hesitation.

To the 25,000 members of Gachon, our Student Council will never stand by and watch unjust behavior that infringes upon students' rights both internally and externally, and will become a Student Council that protects the democracy of our great nation with the spirit of fraternal love (博愛), service (奉仕), and patriotism (愛國).

South Korea is not currently facing a “state of war, armed conflict, or a national emergency equivalent thereto,” nor does public safety or order necessitate military intervention. President Yoon Suk-yeol’s abrupt declaration of martial law on December 3, 2024, blatantly violates the Martial Law Act, disregarding even the most fundamental procedural requirements. The ordinances issued under martial law constitute a direct assault on the constitutional order. Far from addressing any genuine crisis, these actions appear to serve the President’s personal interests, creating a self-imposed emergency that undermines democracy itself.

The images of martial law forces seizing control of the National Assembly, obstructing its proceedings, and suppressing legislative functions serve as chilling reminders of how quickly the foundations of democracy can be destabilized. The proclamation that “all media and publications shall be subject to the control of the Martial Law Command” launched an attack on press freedom, shaking democracy to its core. Yet, truth cannot be silenced. The press exists to check and criticize the abuse of power, and in the wake of martial law’s revocation, countless media outlets have reaffirmed their indispensable role in exposing injustice.

As the University Press of Konkuk University, we will not remain mere bystanders. We are committed to recording the truth of the December 3 Martial Law Crisis, exposing abuses of power, and upholding justice. Inspired by Konkuk University’s proud legacy, including the 1986 pro-democracy movement, and guided by the principles of SungShinUi (誠信義)—Sincerity, Fidelity, and Righteousness—we rise in resistance against this unjust exercise of power to safeguard the freedoms and sovereignty entrusted to us.

First, We condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol for turning the instruments of martial law against the nation.

First, We call for the protection of the nation’s safety, sovereignty, and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, assembly, and association.

Prospective teachers who witnessed the destruction of democracy will not remain silent.

On the night of December 3, 2024, at 22:27, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law "to eradicate anti-state forces that plunder the people's freedom and happiness and to protect the free constitutional order." The Martial Law Command issued Proclamation No. 1, which controlled all media and publications and prohibited all political activities including political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations. Armed martial law troops descended from helicopters over Seoul, broke the glass windows of the National Assembly main building, and entered to prevent the National Assembly plenary session. For the first time in 45 years since 1979, a surprise and unilateral emergency martial law was declared, holding the daily lives of the people hostage. President Yoon Suk-yeol's unconstitutional martial law is a disgrace to the history of democracy that our citizens built with their blood.

How can we forget the history of our people who fought against unjust state power, justifying inhumane acts of violence by pointing the guns of martial law troops at our citizens? We cannot stand by and watch the regression of democracy in the Republic of Korea. We prospective teachers do not want to leave a shameful history for our children. We ask whether this was truly a national emergency that necessitated restricting the people's basic rights. We demand an apology for anti-democratic actions and stern accountability. Who are the truly anti-national forces that oppress our people's freedom and happiness and drive them into violence?

We prospective teachers will fulfill our calling as educators to protect the democracy of the Republic of Korea and stand without shame before our children.

President Yoon Suk-yeol, who committed anti-democratic and anti-national acts, must be judged before the people and before history. It should be recorded as a history where citizens judged him through democracy, not a history where he received no judgment despite shaking the foundation of democracy and threatening the safety of the people. When we become teachers and stand at the podium in the future, we must be able to stand upright and teach without shame about the democracy that citizens protected. This history must be constantly remembered through our voices and through the voices of our children.

Education university students nationwide have continued the struggle of prospective teachers through strikes and declarations in 2016 under the calling that "we will create the history we will teach." So that we can convey to children without distortion the basic constitutional value that sovereignty of the Republic of Korea lies with the people and all power comes from the people, and so that oppression of the people and denial of constitutional order will never be repeated again, we will lead the way as prospective teachers to protect democracy.

One, we condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's unconstitutional emergency martial law.

One, we prospective teachers will fulfill our calling as educators and hold accountable those responsible for anti-democratic and anti-national acts.

        desc: `Today (7th) at 10 AM, Yoon Suk-yeol said in an address to the nation, "I will not avoid legal and political responsibility regarding this martial law declaration," adding that "there will never be a second martial law." But who can believe those words? We cannot be reassured by the words of a head of state who did not even follow the principle of immediately notifying the National Assembly upon declaring martial law. Moreover, the intention behind his statement that he "entrusts future political management to our party" is clear. He appealed to People Power Party lawmakers to prevent his impeachment. The 1 minute 53 second video was not so much an "address to the nation" but rather a desperate plea to the "People Power Party" to save him.

Later at 17:00, the Kim Keon-hee special prosecutor law and Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment motion were put to a vote. In the plenary session that began with all 300 members present, the Kim Keon-hee special prosecutor law was rejected with 198 votes in favor and 102 against. However, the seats soon became empty. This was because People Power Party lawmakers left the National Assembly before the vote on Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment motion. For an impeachment motion to pass, "more than two-thirds of sitting members must vote in favor," and by ensuring the number of seats did not meet the passage requirement, they automatically caused the motion to fail. Unlike citizens who filled the streets across the nation, People Power Party lawmakers were nowhere to be seen, except for Ahn Cheol-soo. Opposition lawmakers and citizens called out the names of People Power Party lawmakers who did not participate in the vote, urging them to attend, but ultimately Speaker Woo Won-sik declared the vote invalid at 21:26.

Today was frustrating. The address to the nation was nothing more than empty promises and ugly desperation, and the People Power Party chose to run away rather than fight. However, we must neither be complacent nor give up. The possibility of martial law and resistance against it are still ongoing. As long as there exists a head of state who pulls out martial law for his own political position, a second martial law is always possible, and as long as an insurrectionist brazenly occupies the position of head of state, resistance cannot end.

The Democratic Party announced that it will reintroduce the rejected impeachment motion through an extraordinary session on the 11th. We are still on the streets.

We will hold our ground to the end against violence that threatens daily life and forces that threaten democracy.

Around 10 PM on December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law, announcing it was "unavoidable for the perpetuity of the free Republic of Korea." He also declared martial law to protect the liberal democracy of the Republic of Korea, saying "the National Assembly has become a monster that destroys the liberal democratic system." However, it was President Yoon Suk-yeol himself who restricted access to the National Assembly through martial law troops at midnight on the 3rd and controlled all political activities, media, and publications through proclamations. We want to ask if he knows that he himself is the monster destroying the democratic system.

The "democratic" in Democratic Dongduk comes from 8,000 Dongduk members. The Dongduk Women's University Student Council and Central Operating Committee, which have fought for democracy, feel enormous anger at the situation where the nation's democracy is threatened and strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law to defend democracy.

President Yoon Suk-yeol's actions are acts that damage democracy and the rule of law, and acts that betray all citizens. Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea states "The Republic of Korea is a democratic republic," and Paragraph 2 states "The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea lies with the people, and all power comes from the people." These constitutional rights of the people were violated and threatened by the nation's protector. In a single moment, with one statement by the President, all citizens fell into despair and anger. As President, as one who exists to protect the people, are you not ashamed of all these acts? We are deeply ashamed. We cannot tolerate one who threatened the people and made them tremble with fear. As intellectuals who wish for the well-being of democracy, we condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol who practices anti-democracy and anti-rule of law.

In just 6 hours, the emergency martial law was lifted with 190 National Assembly members attending and 190 voting in favor. Until it was lifted, there were citizens who ran to the National Assembly in anger even in the middle of the night, and even after it was lifted, there were many university students who went to the National Assembly to hold accountable those who made wrong judgments and to protect us. As university students of Democratic Dongduk, we will not forget President Yoon Suk-yeol's wrongdoing and will demand accountability to the end.

        desc: `On the night of December 3rd, the Yoon Suk-yeol administration declared emergency martial law, seriously damaging our country's democracy and constitutional order. This is an act that completely denies Article 1 of the Constitution and can be called an anachronistic act of violence attempting to suppress the people's freedom and rights through force. We can no longer tolerate a president who trampled on the people's basic rights and violated constitutional order.

Under the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, martial law can only be declared under strict standards during wartime, armed conflict, or equivalent national emergencies. However, the martial law declared by the Yoon Suk-yeol administration did not meet any of these requirements and was a clear illegal act lacking procedural legitimacy. For 6 hours until martial law was lifted, the people trembled in fear under dictatorial proclamations. Even after that, there was no swift apology, let alone showing the minimum sense of responsibility toward the people. This is a betrayal of the people's trust as head of state, and he has undoubtedly forfeited his qualifications for that position.

Democracy cannot be swayed by one person's arbitrary will. This is a precious value that all people of this land must protect and build together, and an inviolable domain for the future of the Republic of Korea. We firmly reject any attempt to violate or suppress the people's rights and freedoms.

How can we overlook the behavior of a country's representative who threatens the people's lives and attempts to violate their rights? The Yoon Suk-yeol administration's arbitrary and anti-democratic behavior is no different from violent acts that destroy the history of democracy built by our ancestors and shake its foundation. We can no longer overlook this tragic reality. We will act to correct the national chaos and damage to people's lives caused by his obstinacy over the past two years.

We are the "Acting Daughters of Geunhwa." Inheriting the self-reliant (自立的), self-generating (自生的), and self-awakening (自覺的) spirit left by Teacher Cha Mi-ri-sa, our eternal teacher of the people and independence activist, we will resist to protect democracy, which is the foundation of democratic virtue. We will reflect on Teacher Cha Mi-ri-sa's teachings and never retreat before history and before the future of the Republic of Korea.

President Yoon Suk-yeol of the Republic of Korea declared emergency martial law.
President Yoon Suk-yeol referred to certain National Assembly members as "shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces that plunder the happiness of the free Republic of Korea" and "the source of national ruin that engages in evil acts," attempting to suppress them and the people through "emergency martial law."

Emergency martial law can be declared by the president when wartime, armed conflict, or equivalent national emergencies occur.

But is the current situation like that?

Emergency martial law can seriously damage the people's basic rights, which could be confirmed in the proclamation issued by the Martial Law Command.

According to the proclamation, all political activities including the activities of the National Assembly and local assemblies, political parties, political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations were prohibited, and all media and publications were to be controlled by the martial law command, attempting to gag the people.

Furthermore, it stated that all medical personnel, including resident doctors, who were on strike or had left medical sites must return to their jobs within 48 hours, and violators would be "dealt with" according to martial law.

Does the president think that when he gags the people, the people should accept it, and those who don't should be subjects to be dealt with?

Additionally, for the past four days since martial law was declared, numerous foreign media have not stopped criticizing President Yoon Suk-yeol, which is a diplomatic embarrassment and humiliation for our country.

Finally, countless citizens are losing sleep, anxiously wondering when the president, who should be at the forefront of protecting the people's lives and property, might declare martial law again.

Is he truly a president for the people?
Is he truly a president existing in the 21st century?

Furthermore, whether he can continue to perform presidential duties

We cannot help but doubt.
Whenever the country was in chaos and state affairs were in disorder, it was not the government but the people who defended the free Republic of Korea and protected the free constitutional order, and our university has a proud history of proving this through the Buma Democratic Uprising.

Twenty thousand Hyowon members who know better than anyone how the democracy of the Republic of Korea was established! Let us all be angry together, remembering the democratic spirit of our seniors who shed blood and sweat to protect democracy. And let us shout powerfully:
Yoon Suk-yeol, step down.
This is the people's order.

Pusan National University Student Council declares that it will struggle to the end to defend the democracy of the free Republic of Korea without succumbing to any external pressure.

        desc: `-Put to the Resolution of the General Student Assembly on December 5, 2024 -

We never rest content in the comfort of the ivory tower. Today, we take reason and truth as our weapons against the turbulent waves of oppression. Our conscience commands us. We cannot remain silent before the reality of injustice. The secret of freedom is courage alone.

Article 69 of the Constitution: "I solemnly swear before the people that I will faithfully perform my duties as President by observing the Constitution, defending the state, working for the peaceful unification of the homeland, the enhancement of the people's freedom and welfare, and the development of national culture." This is the oath that Yoon Suk-yeol pledged before the people at his presidential inauguration. Yoon Suk-yeol has thoroughly betrayed this oath. Far from protecting the Constitution, he has violated the people's rights, destroyed the rule of law, and shaken the foundation of democracy.

On December 3, 2024, Yoon Suk-yeol issued an unconstitutional emergency martial law that did not meet the martial law requirements specified in Article 77 of the Constitution. The Martial Law Command trampled freedom of political association and assembly under military boots and silenced the media through Proclamation No. 1. This is an anti-democratic act of violence that mocks the democracy of the Republic of Korea and seriously violates the people's basic rights, and it is absolutely unacceptable.

Mobilizing the military for political purposes is a serious challenge to constitutional order. As students of Seoul National University and citizens of the Republic of Korea, to protect democracy and the rule of law, we firmly declare that we cannot recognize Yoon Suk-yeol, filled with lack of communication and arrogance, as president.

Seoul National University shines with a history of standing against injustice. That light is the foundation of our university spirit and the value demanded by our times. The mission given to us is clear. We will defend the democratic constitutional order against all injustice. Let the flame of people's liberation become a torch of freedom to illuminate the naked truth of despotism. The night of oppression is not long. Our cry toward freedom will drive out darkness and become the light that illuminates the era.

We are not afraid. Just as the resistance of martyr Park Jong-cheol was, history is written with the blood of those who fought against injustice. Let us write a page of that history together. No matter how strong the oppression, no matter how deep the darkness, it cannot break our yearning for truth and freedom. We declare to Yoon Suk-yeol, who seeks to reduce democracy to a mere hollow shell:

One, we condemn Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of emergency martial law, which abandoned the president's duty to protect constitutional values.

One, we condemn the act of attempting to trample our academic hall with proclamations that restrict academic freedom.

One, we strongly urge Yoon Suk-yeol, who trampled the April 19 democratic ideals with his unconstitutional declaration of emergency martial law, to step down from the presidency.

        desc: `On December 3, 2024, Yoon Seok-yeol made a decision that goes against the people's memory and history. The emergency martial law declared on that day clearly violated the constitutional order of our society and gravely threatened our nation's democracy and constitutional values.

The Martial Law Command issued Proclamation No. 1, placing all media and publications under the control of the martial law authorities. We remember the history of the 1980s when the military junta's strict media control extended its reach to university media. If martial law had not been lifted, all media and publishing personnel in the Republic of Korea would have been seized once again under the command of censorship units.

University media today has continuously faced questions about what value it holds, doubts about what it can accomplish, and anxieties about whether it can survive. We know the feeling of ultimately swallowing words we want to speak. We know the heart that erases sentences out of fear for the future we must take responsibility for.

However, that is not all we remember. We also know the heart that did not let go of the pen even in the midst of the horror when riot police broke down editorial room doors and seized books and materials. We know that the courage to continue printing by ultimately protecting manuscripts that were nearly confiscated multiple times made our current freedom possible.

Therefore, we cannot remain silent in the face of oppressive martial law maneuvers. We will continue the courage of documentation and struggle. We will not abandon the history of student journalism that our predecessors built with their blood.

Yoon Seok-yeol must take responsibility for the illegal martial law that damaged democracy and thoroughly trampled on the people's basic rights and resign immediately. The conspirators of emergency martial law must also pay the price for their crimes.

However, this declaration of emergency martial law did not correspond to wartime, civil war, or equivalent national emergency situations as stipulated in Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, and also violated Article 4 of the Martial Law Act regarding notification of martial law declaration.

Immediately after the declaration, proclamations were announced that restricted basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution. According to the proclamations and martial law, political activities are prohibited, media is controlled, and violators can be arrested or detained without warrant. The behavior of a president who advocates for the free constitutional order is deplorable.

We condemn President Yoon Seok-yeol for declaring unconstitutional and anti-democratic emergency martial law.

Popular sovereignty, popular self-governance, constitutionalism, separation of powers. These are the basic principles of democratic politics that we have learned and will teach in the future. History that we saw only in writing has manifested in our present, shaking the foundation of democracy. We deeply realize that what we inherited has actually been protected all along. These are the democracy and freedom of the Republic of Korea that were historically won through effort and sacrifice. We raise our voices to protect them.

We want to live in a democratic nation. As democratic citizens, we want to teach democracy. We want to pass on democracy and freedom to our children. We want to teach what is natural as natural.

        desc: `At approximately 22:23 on December 3, 2024, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared emergency martial law. This was the first time in 44 years since the military dictatorship era before democratization. Subsequently, around 23:00, a martial law command proclamation was announced that restricted the basic rights of citizens specified in the Constitution, using the term "punishment." Thus, on that night, all residents of the Republic of Korea had no choice but to stay up all night watching the situation unfold, simply to protect their freedom, safety, and daily lives.

We witnessed police swarming into the National Assembly building to control the entry and exit of lawmakers. Subsequently, we clearly heard and saw armed martial law troops entering the premises with helicopters, breaking the windows of the main building and attempting to enter the main assembly hall. These series of surreal and inhumane scenes still linger as terror and shame for the people. The martial law command under President Yoon Seok-yeol systemically and organizationally ordered the physical seizure of the National Assembly and the arrest of lawmakers, including party leaders from both ruling and opposition parties, to prevent the National Assembly's resolution—the only way to lift martial law. The National Election Commission was also illegally occupied and searched by approximately 300 martial law troops, which was also based on unconstitutional and illegal orders and their execution.

At 1:01 AM, the National Assembly passed a resolution demanding the lifting of martial law, but police continued to control the area in front of the National Assembly in shifts, and the martial law command was not immediately disbanded. Only after more than three hours did President Yoon announce a statement saying he would lift martial law through a Cabinet meeting, and after the Cabinet meeting voted to lift it, the emergency martial law was completely lifted after approximately 330 minutes.

The sudden martial law imposed on December 3 was barely prevented by 190 lawmakers and citizens, who are the nation's eternal strength. This martial law was not only declared during a non-emergency state but was not even notified to the National Assembly—it was illegal, unconstitutional, and an unimaginable anti-democratic rebellion in the Republic of Korea in 2024. However, President Yoon Seok-yeol issued a statement saying he was "sorry for the inconvenience," clearly showing his lack of will for proper reflection and apology for the military rebellion. Furthermore, because the truth of the martial law remains shrouded in mystery and, above all, the destruction of the constitutional order that determines the nation's survival might be attempted again, citizens have not been able to feel secure for even a moment from immediately after the martial law until now.

At the beginning of a new phase that will determine the nation's fate in any direction, students of Korea National University of Arts do not want to remain silent about this emergency situation and wish to fulfill their respective roles. In other words, this statement of the current situation is the foundation for our practice and will.

The main building of Korea National University of Arts was established on the site where the former ANSP (Agency for National Security Planning) building once stood—an organization that carried out control and oppression in the past. As young artists opening up the future anew on the foundation of the blood and sweat of previous generations, we, the students of Korea National University of Arts, feel anger that overwhelms fear in the face of this regressive atrocity that broke the hands of history's clock. Furthermore, reflecting on our university's founding philosophy of "creative minority," we infinitely condemn the oppression by this martial law group that instantly took away the basic rights of democratic citizens to freely express their unique thoughts and emotions and to resist injustice without reservation.

Art is the mirror of the times and the conscience of society. Art is the newness and beauty that comes from living together, remembers lives that cannot be here and now, and moves toward a life that hopes for better coexistence and solidarity. We can no longer stand by and watch the injustice of President Yoon Seok-yeol, who should protect the Constitution and safeguard the people's safety, plunging the people's lives into the abyss of terror and shame together with his collaborators.

As artists, we will not remain silent in the face of such injustice. We clearly recognize the value of this nation's art, which has been able to continue the long thread of history through the sacrifices of previous lives. We will continue our movements and songs on the stage of history, and we will bloom rhythms and images.

This is a matter of life caused by heinous crimes that made any kind of politics impossible, before it is a political problem. So, this is our problem.

And we will hold accountable all attempts to suppress democratic justice and resist to the end. Art does not bow to the oppression of power.

This is a clear anti-state act plotting rebellion. How could someone calling himself president declare emergency martial law without any regard for citizens' lives? With ambition solely for his own power, Yoon Seok-yeol has paralyzed state affairs.

How absurd is the excuse that he declared martial law without even meeting legal requirements to inform citizens of the opposition's atrocities? Does he still not realize that Yoon Seok-yeol himself, who committed political oppression by holding citizens' freedom hostage, is precisely the uncompromising anti-state force of the Republic of Korea? How can such a shameless person who deceived citizens still be the president of a nation? The National Assembly must carry on the will of the citizens and eliminate Yoon Seok-yeol, the culprit of national ruin.
Yoon Seok-yeol attempted to restrict citizens' freedoms of "politics," "assembly," and "expression"—who are the sovereign of the state—using rhetoric of "liberal democracy" and "anti-state." Nevertheless, we saw citizens gathering in Yeouido to secure their individual freedoms. We saw bodies constantly acting in the square to prevent our bodies from being restrained by state power. Judith Butler says: "The condition that finally makes our one and only life worth living. That is our seizing of freedom. It is struggling with these constrained bodies of ours."

In this land, those who long for freedom more than anyone else are minorities. We know this. We know that in this land where freedom has disappeared, minorities are the first to be persecuted. Until now, we have restricted minorities' freedom under the pretext of infringing on the rights of the majority. We have ignored minorities' cries, claiming there is insufficient social consensus. This is no different whether it's the current National Assembly that has turned away from minorities or Yoon Seok-yeol who declared emergency martial law. However, minorities who have lived their entire lives as second-class citizens of the state appeal to the National Assembly: Now impeach Yoon Seok-yeol, who has attempted to oppress even the freedom of the majority of citizens.

And we appeal to minorities in this land: We have already sufficiently and thoroughly hidden, deceived, and denied ourselves. But today, let us liberate our oppressed bodies. Let us seize our freedom. Civil society has progressed through minorities' cries, so let us together achieve transformation. The Sexual Minorities Rights Committee will join in the gestures of freedom that minorities in this land envision.

Today, citizens will be victorious.

Our university strongly condemns this series of events that shake the foundation of our nation and declares the following position to restore justice and freedom in the Republic of Korea.

Our Position on Constitutional Destruction and Acts of Insurrection

The anti-constitutional situation currently unfolding in the Republic of Korea is seriously undermining the democratic values and constitutional order of our society. Violence against the National Assembly, military actions threatening the lives and safety of citizens, and attempts to paralyze constitutional institutions cannot be justified under any circumstances. We clearly recognize that these acts are not mere political conflicts but serious acts of insurrection that shake the foundation of the Constitution and democracy. Students of Gangseo University strongly demand severe punishment of those responsible and restoration of national order.

Our Commitment to Protecting Students' Rights and Academic Freedom

Gangseo University has been producing countless talented individuals who contribute to society through learning and truth since its establishment in 1958. However, the recent series of events shows the risk of violation of academic freedom and students' rights. All students at Gangseo University have the right to pursue learning in a free and safe environment. To protect this right, we, as the Student Council Emergency Committee, will take active action. Our position will contribute solely to restoring democracy and justice.

Our Demands Including President Yoon Seok-yeol's Resignation

The Gangseo University Student Council Emergency Committee holds President Yoon Seok-yeol accountable for destroying the democratic order of the Republic of Korea. The President has the duty to protect citizens' rights and the functions of the National Assembly as a guardian of the Constitution. However, the President's actions revealed in the current situation have abandoned this duty.

Therefore, we demand the following:

    First, thoroughly investigate and legally punish all those involved in constitutional violations and acts of insurrection.
    Second, immediately restore democratic order that guarantees citizens' lives and safety and does not infringe upon academic freedom.
    Third, President Yoon Seok-yeol must immediately resign and fulfill national responsibility for restoring democratic order.

In 2024, we once again faced a dark reality. On December 3, 2024, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law under the pretext of protecting the Republic of Korea against anti-state forces. The Martial Law Command completely banned the National Assembly, local councils, political party activities, political gatherings, assemblies and demonstrations through Proclamation No. 1, and suppressed freedom of press and publication.

However, martial law is a measure permitted only during wartime, incidents of war, or national emergencies equivalent to these as stipulated by the Constitution. Nevertheless, President Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law in a situation where requirements were not met.

Presidential authority is not personal but power derived from the people.

Martial law was used as the last bastion of dictatorial regimes, and we faced this dark past again after 44 years. Police blocked the doors of the National Assembly, martial law forces pointed guns at citizens, and the sky was filled with the roar of armed helicopters. The President, who has the duty to protect citizens' freedom and rights, mobilized the military that should protect the people to show off his power and create anxiety.


As Educators Who Will Spread Education to the World, We Will Raise Our Voices for Tomorrow

As prospective teachers, we cannot overlook all these situations. Chuncheon National University of Education cultivates the vision of "Humans in Heart, Education in the World." We have the mission as educators to carry democratic values in our hearts under any circumstances. And we must be able to teach children that the Republic of Korea is a democratic nation without shame.

As prospective teachers who will lead in practicing the teachings of democracy, the Chuncheon National University of Education Student Council condemns President Yoon Seok-yeol's declaration of martial law and calls for President Yoon Seok-yeol's impeachment.

On December 3, 2024, state power abandoned its original responsibility to protect the people and targeted the National Assembly, the representative institution of the people. The declaration of martial law proceeded without the consent of the people, let alone procedural legitimacy. Even public officials who knew about this were extremely few.

We are not simply trying to consider political interests. This martial law incident could have developed into a terrible situation where 'my' friends, conscripted as national troops to defend the Republic of Korea, could point tearful gun barrels at 'us.'

This is not just our affair. Our grandparents' generation experienced the history of war, and our parents' generation experienced the history of dictatorship.

Our Demands to Legislative and Judicial Institutions:

        desc: `On December 3, 2024, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law. An attempt was made to suppress the people under military boots across the Republic of Korea, ignoring the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the values of democracy. This is an unconstitutional measure that ignores constitutional procedures and directly undermines the democracy of the Republic of Korea, which is based on the values of freedom and equality.

The act of invading the National Assembly under the pretext of martial law, controlling the media, and suppressing the people's political freedom is an undemocratic atrocity reminiscent of the military regime era. We must once again recall that the president's power is delegated by the Constitution and the people, and that the president has the responsibility to protect the people's fundamental rights and constitutional order.

Daegu National University of Education is a place where prospective teachers learn and teach the values of democracy. As prospective teachers who will be responsible for elementary education in this land, we have a mission to pass on the values of justice, equality, and freedom to future generations. However, remaining silent in the face of a reality where the president himself abandons constitutional values is abandoning our responsibility as prospective teachers and as citizens of the Republic of Korea.

Today, witnessing this moment when democracy in the Republic of Korea is shaking, we clearly recognize that silence is complicity with injustice. Therefore, we declare as follows:

First, we strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's unconstitutional declaration of martial law and strongly demand his immediate accountability.

Second, we demand the resignation of President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has abandoned his duty to protect the Constitution.

Third, we declare that we will participate in all legitimate actions to protect democracy.

We declare that democracy in the Republic of Korea can never be undermined by the arbitrariness and arrogance of those in power. Education is the mirror of society, and when educators remain silent, the world falls into darkness. As prospective teachers and citizens of the Republic of Korea, we will protect democracy in the Republic of Korea through solidarity and action, and teach the values of freedom and equality to future generations.

        desc: `Let's work together with those who have been excluded from "the people" for guaranteeing labor rights and Yoon Suk-yeol's resignation

On the night of December 3 (Tuesday), Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law despite the absence of wartime conditions or situations equivalent to war. Through Martial Law Command Proclamation No. 1, which was illegal even under martial law, he attempted to prohibit political activities of the National Assembly, mobilized military and police forces like a private organization to seize various judicial and administrative institutions, and attempted to arrest key figures including labor union leaders. This is clearly insurrection and an attempt at a palace coup that cannot be defended with any rhetoric, and clearly constitutes immediate grounds for impeachment.

Citizens were greatly angered by the attempt to destroy democracy and deny rights that had been taken for granted. Immediately after martial law, thousands of citizens gathered in front of the National Assembly building to prevent the martial law forces from invading the National Assembly. On December 7 (Saturday), the day of the impeachment motion vote, up to one million citizens gathered in Yeouido to demand Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment. Student and faculty declarations were issued consecutively at universities nationwide, and Seoul National University also held a student assembly and passed a motion demanding Yoon Suk-yeol's resignation with overwhelming enthusiasm. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions declared a general strike for Yoon Suk-yeol's resignation, and while both major labor federations united in demanding impeachment, many labor unions in Asia and around the world sent international solidarity and support to Korean labor. Delivery workers, irregular school workers and educational civil servants in school cafeterias, railway workers, and other workers whose labor rights had been violated by the Yoon Suk-yeol administration went on strike, saying that resignation was essential for labor safety and workplace democracy. For the rights of workers and students, and for the safety of all citizens, Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment was too urgent.

However, on the night of December 7, following Yoon Suk-yeol, this time the ruling People Power Party betrayed the will of the citizens. Despite the anti-democratic outrage that attempted to suspend human rights and labor rights, they adopted opposition to impeachment as their party line, considering only their own safety and political interests, and by not even participating in the impeachment motion vote, they caused the impeachment bill to be automatically discarded. This can only be seen as a de facto act of conspiracy and support for insurrection, admitting that they are in cahoots with Yoon Suk-yeol, who committed insurrection.

We clearly remember how the democratic labor union movement that was reviving through the April 19 Revolution was trampled under martial law after the May 16 military coup in 1961, and what violence the Korean Central Intelligence Agency exercised to reorganize labor unions into government-controlled organizations. The oppressive labor policies and systems established in this way continued into oppressive labor control through emergency measures and the National Security Act under the Yushin system of the 1970s. We also remember how the democratic labor unions of female workers who had brought down the Yushin system were trampled by the military boots of the new military government after the nationwide expansion of martial law on May 17, 1980. We feel in today's workplaces since 1987 how the history of the new military government's martial law, which suppressed industrial unions, prohibited social solidarity, and arrested and excluded union members en masse, has blocked workers' autonomous and democratic rights advocacy.

Remembering the history of labor rights being destroyed by martial law and coups, we must never overlook the People Power Party's conspiracy in insurrection. A president who illegally declared martial law and turned guns on citizens should not continue to hold military command authority. We condemn the shamelessness of advocating insurrection laws against "the people" while bearing the party name People Power Party, and we must take to the streets to show the true "people's power."

No, we must not stop there. Let us show the voices and power of those who have been pushed outside the "people" that they speak of and have had to live their daily lives under martial law. Irregular workers who were driven to death by union suppression and inadequate labor safety, precarious workers who were denied "worker status" and excluded from constitutional rights such as the minimum wage, female workers who were placed under multiple oppression due to the devaluation of care work and queer workers who have constantly suffered discrimination in the workplace, migrant workers who were declared an exception zone of rule of law and democracy under the name of "registration" and were deprived of even basic rights - we must shout together in the square and create together the world after resignation that they desire.

Finally, we shout to the People Power Party members who repeated the historical error of coups and democratic rights deprivation: "The People Power Party must immediately stop its acts of conspiracy in insurrection!" We will gather that cry until impeachment is achieved and directly draw the world after Yoon Suk-yeol.

The 5th Student Council of Shinhan University strongly condemns President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law.

At 22:23 on December 3, 2024, martial law was declared throughout the Republic of Korea through a public address. This was a measure taken when it was unclear whether the National Assembly's blockade of the martial law declaration as specified in the Constitution was in effect, and when the requirements for a national emergency were not met.

Members of this council are guaranteed the rights specified in the Constitution. Article 5 (Rights and Duties of Members) of Shinhan University Student Council Regulations

The 5th Student Council of Shinhan University feels deep responsibility for the fact that the rights of citizens and students, which should naturally be protected by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, have been usurped. As citizens of the Republic of Korea and members of the university community, we cannot tolerate this incident as it has seriously undermined the values of democracy and constitutional order, and threatened the safety and fundamental rights of our fellow students.

The 5th Student Council of Shinhan University will raise its voice to protect the values of democracy centered on the people, who are the sovereigns of the Republic of Korea, and the right to receive education safely under any circumstances.

We urge the President and all personnel involved in oppressing the people to listen to the people's voices and fulfill their constitutional responsibilities to resolve this incident for a safe Republic of Korea where such incidents will not recur.

The justification of "people's freedom and safety and national sustainability" and the term "martial law" that oppresses people's fundamental rights can never coexist.

The 5th Student Council of Shinhan University deeply empathizes with facing the grave historical task of raising a resolute voice to protect democracy in the Republic of Korea and, above all, to protect Shinhan University students. We will defend the values of democracy and the Constitution with an active voice. We will also continue peaceful and neutral resistance according to the understanding and demands of our fellow students.

Even in confusion, we will raise our voices loudly for democratic values and a free society. Carrying the voices of students, we will contribute to democracy in the Republic of Korea with trust and responsibility.

Constitution of the Republic of Korea Article 1 Paragraph 1: The Republic of Korea is a democratic republic. Paragraph 2: The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people, and all power comes from the people.

December 9, 2024 5th Student Council of Shinhan University

The 5th Student Council of Shinhan University will maintain a balanced attitude with political neutrality as the primary principle of not leaning toward any side in the process of viewing this matter. Through this, we will fulfill a role that all members of the university community can trust, and we promise to do our best to ensure that students do not suffer any disadvantage under any circumstances, especially by prioritizing students' rights and safety above all else.

We clarify that this is a condemnation statement to protect democracy in the Republic of Korea, and that the purpose is solely to defend democracy, not to support specific political parties or incite political conflict.

Recently encountering the martial law declaration incident in the Republic of Korea, we felt that democracy and constitutional order were under serious threat. Universities are spaces of truth and freedom, and we raise our voices so that the values of liberal democracy are protected without being undermined.

[Was President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law during wartime, national emergency, or equivalent national emergency?]

President Yoon Suk-yeol's declaration of martial law around 22:00 on December 3, 2024, was made without concrete and understandable explanation to the people and was an act that undermined constitutional order. According to Article 77, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Martial Law Act, this is a serious unconstitutional act that shakes the foundation of democracy in the Republic of Korea.

[We cannot tolerate acts that trample democracy and abuse of power.]

The Martial Law Command prohibited all political activities including the activities of the National Assembly and local assemblies, political parties, political associations, assemblies, and demonstrations through Proclamation No. 1, and restricted all freedom of speech and publication. This martial law violated citizens' fundamental rights, and the martial law forces' entry into the National Assembly main building was clearly an anti-constitutional act of constitutional disorder. Without notifying the National Assembly, the sole legislative body of the Republic of Korea, they attempted to illegally occupy the National Assembly, a legislative institution, by mobilizing martial law forces. This clearly did not go through proper procedures as specified in the Constitution and is clearly an unconstitutional act that tramples the liberal democratic constitutional order.

[We demand appropriate punishment for those responsible for undermining the Constitution and laws.]

The declaration of martial law was an act that undermined constitutional values and shook the foundation of democracy in the Republic of Korea. Therefore, we demand that the clear reasons for invoking martial law be revealed to the people in detail and continuous apology. All personnel involved in oppressing the people must be thoroughly investigated and held accountable.

Hoseo University Student Council will never stop our steps to defend freedom in the Republic of Korea and will resist all acts that attempt to destroy democracy. If state power betrays the people's trust, we will act resolutely and will not compromise with injustice.

We strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol's undermining of democratic values and violation of constitutional order.

We will not stand idly by as the constitutional order of Korea collapses.
On December 3, 2024, at 22:27, the declaration of emergency martial law after 45 years was enough to plunge the entire nation into a quagmire of distrust and anxiety. The helicopters and wafting smoke blotted out the stars in the night sky and threatened people's daily lives. The martial law command's Proclamation No. 1 prohibited all political activities, including the activities of the National Assembly, local councils, political parties, associations, rallies, and demonstrations, and sought to eliminate all freedom of speech and publication. This catastrophe, which was implemented in the name of crushing anti-state forces that sought to overthrow the constitutional order, will go down in textbooks as an act of folly that turned the muzzle of the gun on the people in an unconstitutional outburst.

We are education students who are supposed to explore the truth.
We are pre-service teachers who will study the right history and teach it to our children. Our eyes are to be directed to the truth, our ears are to discern falsehood, and our mouths are to preach righteousness. However, President Yoon Seok-yeol's emergency martial law decree, which led to this anti-constitutional disaster, left a scar on the Gwangju region that was shrouded in the darkness of May 18th. It was an attempt to blind our eyes to the truth, to close our ears to discern falsehoods, and to muzzle our mouths to speak the truth, which we must explore.

We are students of justice.
We are pre-service teachers who will carry the torch of a just democracy. We are the embers that will nurture the future of this country, and we must overcome this turbulence by uniting into a huge flame that will devour injustice. In the spirit of our predecessors at Gwangju National University of Education, we will continue to defend the system we will teach. We must take the righteous step so that we do not shamefully teach the wrong history in the space of our children.

We are education students walking the path of proud teachers.
We want to fulfill our calling as pre-service teachers to be teachers who are not ashamed to be in front of children in the midst of this turmoil. As truth-seekers, we will seek to uncover the truth about what happened, and we will stand up to defend democracy and constitutional order as we define it. We will continue to move forward, remembering that we are proud to walk in the footsteps of our teachers. It is our power and right as pre-service teachers to correct the history we will teach.

        desc: `On the night of December 3rd, the word "emergency martial law," which remained in the dark modern history of the Republic of Korea, suddenly re-emerged and shook the constitutional order. Emergency martial law, as specified in the Constitution, can only be permitted in extremely limited situations such as wartime, national emergency, or equivalent national crisis situations. However, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared it without meeting any of the requirements for emergency martial law specified in the Constitution. The president who pledged to "uphold the Constitution and defend the nation" privatized the power granted by the people and mobilized the military, which should protect the people, to threaten democracy and create anxiety.

The president's subsequent statement contained no genuine apology or acknowledgment of any responsibility. The spark of anger that arose in the hearts of students and citizens who nearly lost their democracy grew even larger, and the collapsed constitutional order remains unrestored. Moreover, on December 7th, 105 ruling party lawmakers left the plenary session without expressing their stance on impeachment, causing the vote to fail. Therefore, we in 2024 wish to reflect once more on the voice of democracy that all citizens raised throughout the Republic of Korea in 1987.

Even university students and youth who had been cautious in viewing President Yoon Suk-yeol's state administration have now withdrawn all trust and expectations in the president. In the unstable political situation, the people of the Republic of Korea are trapped in fear and anxiety. The illegal martial law declared by the president took away our peaceful daily lives, and the public sentiment angered by this has grown uncontrollably into a frightening whirlpool. The reason our friends, parents, neighbors, and elders take to the streets once again despite the cold winter weather is because they dream of a country where state affairs are operated through freedom and democracy, not dictatorship and violence. It is to confirm that the freedom and rights of the people guaranteed by the Constitution cannot be taken away by anyone.

The president and martial law officials who violated the Constitution to divide the nation must be promptly removed from office and held clearly accountable. Since the president's illegal declaration of martial law, the Republic of Korea has fallen into chaos. The efforts of our ancestors and predecessors who devoted themselves to the independence and democratization of the motherland, for survival and prosperity, have been trampled upon. To protect democracy that has become disconnected from reality in Korean society where only hostility and anger prevail, we wish to raise our voices once more as our predecessors did. As a future generation that pursues learning and justice at universities, we will never stand by and watch this situation, and will continue to demand accountability from President Yoon Suk-yeol and martial law officials.

Respected university student citizens across the nation, we have taken to the streets again. This incident is not a problem limited to specific generations and ideologies. Democracy was achieved through all of our efforts. This is a time when everyone's efforts are needed again to defend democracy. Therefore, we resolve to continue peaceful resistance together with all citizens as students and as citizens, and demand the following:

One, President Yoon Suk-yeol, who declared anti-constitutional and anti-democratic emergency martial law, must immediately resign.

One, President Yoon Suk-yeol and martial law officials who destroyed the constitutional order of the Republic of Korea and threatened democracy must be severely punished.

One, All politicians must properly use the democratic power entrusted by the people for restoring constitutional order and stabilizing the political situation.

“Thanking you for your decision for the people and the country”

Today, as we face a momentous decision in Korean political history, I would like to express my deepest respect for your efforts and hard work. The passage of the impeachment bill against President Yoon Seok-yul was a pivotal moment that clearly demonstrated the workings of our democracy. Those who stood at the crossroads of this process made decisions that went beyond the logic of their political parties and prioritized the interests of the country and its people. This was not a choice taken lightly, but an act of great responsibility to uphold the values of our democracy.

Your decision marks an important milestone that sets a new standard in Korean politics. It is not just a response to an incident, but an important step in restoring public trust and laying the foundation for the future. The responsibility and commitment you showed under difficult circumstances sent a strong message to the entire nation. You have proven that Korean politics can work together with the people and move in the right direction.

In particular, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the members of the National Assembly, including more than a dozen members of the People's Power, who, as the ruling party, made courageous decisions for the people even under realistic constraints and political pressure.

As the President of the Student Government Association representing the students of Wonkwang University and as a citizen of Korea, I express my deepest gratitude for the dedication and sense of responsibility you have shown through this decision. I believe that this decision is of great significance for the development of Korean politics and democracy.

The road ahead will not be smooth, but I believe that today's choice will be a valuable step in the development of Korean politics and society. Your efforts will be remembered by all Koreans, and will contribute to the strengthening of our society.

Once again, I thank and salute you for your hard work and determination for the Republic of Korea. We sincerely recognize your efforts in creating this important moment, and we wish you all the best for the future of our country.

The light of 2600 students at the Student General Assembly became the light of impeachment of Yoon Seok-yul
After President Yoon Seok-yul declared emergency martial law on December 3, Ewha students took action in various ways to defend the history of democracy and liberation. The movement for change culminated in the first student general assembly in six years on December 13, with 2,600 Ewha students participating, and the lighting of a candle to pass the bill to impeach President Yoon Seok-yul, eight years after the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye. It was the history of Liberation Ehwa, the 15,000 Ewha students who tried to create and defend the history of democracy and liberation, and the history of democracy and liberation that impeached President Yoon Seok-yul, who tried to take away the history of democracy and liberation.

Until the light of liberation lit up the light of democracy
The impeachment motion against President Yoon Seok-yul was passed, but it is a beginning, not an end. The declaration of emergency martial law was a clear violation of the constitutional order, and our movement for change must not stop until those who seek to undermine our democracy are arrested and punished. Just as the lights of 2600 people on December 13 blossomed into the lights of impeachment of Yoon Seok-yeol on December 14, we will take to the streets until the lights of liberation lit up the lights of democracy.

It was the pre-service teachers' pledge to not stand idly by while the unconstitutional and illegal state of emergency was imposed, and the pre-service teachers' sense of mission to not stand idly by. The call for presidential accountability went beyond the university to rallies across the country.

The pre-service teachers vowed to take action all the way to the Constitutional Court impeachment trial.

Despite his arrest being driven by clear popular demand, Yoon continued to emphasize that he was the victim of an illegal investigation until the very last moment of his arrest. On the morning of the 16th, he even released an outrageous letter called “A Message to the People,” in which he spat out a rant that “unfortunately, all laws have been broken in this country. In the immediate aftermath of the arrests, sympathy among far-right supporters grew so strong that the party of the insurgency's accomplices, the People's Power, even issued a party-wide statement that it would file charges against the Minister of Public Security and the head of the National Bureau of Investigation for abuse of office. As an added bonus, a slew of edited polls were posted on media sites claiming that Yun and the People's Power's approval ratings had risen since the arrests.

We must fight harder. The greed of the insurrection plotters to use Yoon's arrest as an opportunity for a political resurgence is unchecked. Even if Yoon is arrested, if the Constitutional Court, which is conscious of far-right public opinion, decides to dismiss the impeachment, we will be back to square one. Impeachment is one thing, but the dissolution of the National Assembly is just as problematic, if not more so. If we want to change our lives for the better, if we don't want to see the same people who impeached Park Geun-hye in the past come out to the square to impeach Yoon Seok-yul again, we need to keep fighting.

Now that Yoon Seok-yeol has been arrested, it's the turn of his accomplice, the People's Power. The 2030 youth gathered in the square have come this far in larger and larger numbers each time, standing with the oppressed: workers, peasants, women, LGBT people, and people with disabilities. The countless flags waved by the youth flag bearers in the streets have become a symbol of solidarity, and the songs sung in unison have become a symbol of struggle. For a world where even the last oppressed people can live as human beings, freed from all kinds of discrimination and oppression, the dismantling of the people's power is a necessary step towards such a world.

We, the Yunseok Youth and Students for Social Transformation 2030, propose that we move directly to stop those who did not gather with us on the night of December 3, which made everyone tremble in fear, who did not pass the lifting of martial law, who left the National Assembly in groups to prevent the impeachment vote even after the martial law, which was actually a pro-government coup, and who have been destroying our lives in various ways for the sole purpose of profit.

Since December 3, citizens have been defending democracy with their bare hands, blocking tanks with their bodies, and defending democracy from the bayonets of the martial law forces. People from all walks of life have declared a state of emergency, and student unions have convened in universities to resolve to impeach Yoon Seok-yeol and act to defend democracy. It was citizens, not anyone else, who spoke out and acted in front of the National Assembly on a cold winter day, on the streets of Gwanghwamun, and in Namtae-ryeong to defend the country.

Yoon Seok-yeol, an unrepentant anti-nationalist, must be dismissed.
Article 1, paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea, “The Republic of Korea is a democratic republic,” and “The sovereignty of the Republic of Korea resides in the people, and all power comes from the people. Those in charge of the current government and the instigators of the uprising deny wrongdoing, shirk responsibility, and say that the martial law was justified. Despite the passage of the impeachment motion, arrests, and detentions, which were accomplished through the power of the people, Yoon Seok-yeol is trying to turn the people against the state. Citizens cannot recognize a government that has attempted to provoke an uprising by pointing guns at the people. It is time for the Constitutional Court to unanimously impeach President Yoon Seok-yul.

Let us remember the weight of liberation and act.
Since the imposition of martial law, citizens have been taking to the streets every Saturday to call for the impeachment of Yoon Seok-yul. At Ewha Womans University, the 1809 Ewha students declared a national revolution, and individual signs expressing their anger at the current state of affairs have become a part of the landscape of Ewha. And on December 13, 2,657 Ewha students elected a student general assembly within five days of the call. From the signs around campus, to the countless Ewha students and alumni I meet on the streets of Gwanghwamun, I feel that we all share the weight of liberation. We will feel the name of Liberation Ewha and act responsibly until we see the world we want. We will remember the history of democracy that our seniors have protected in the long history of Ewha, and we will protect Ewha, which was built for women's and national liberation.

One, Liberation Ewha, let's protect the history of democracy and liberation to the end.
One, Liberation Ehwa, a promise to 2,657 Ewha students, let's stand together until Yoon Seok-yeol's dismissal
Hana, the world we will meet again after Yoon Seok-yeol's dismissal, we will create.

        desc: `- Joint Statement by Ewha Rights Organizations Coalition -

We Are Political Beings

Since the opening of the Yoon Seok-yeol impeachment plaza, individual participants and 'unorganized solidarity members' coming to the plaza have been increasing. In Namtaeryeong, comrades with light sticks stood in solidarity against police barricades blocking the Korean Peasants League Federation's tractor protest, and citizen comrades rushed out like wasps to join the Korea Disability Rights Solidarity's subway advocacy campaign during rush hour, preventing forced eviction by police and subway security guards. At the impeachment rallies held every Saturday, various 'random flags' fill the plaza.

At Ewha Womans University, countless students focus on student government elections. They compare campaign promises, examine candidates' backgrounds, and decide which campaign to support and why. They show support for student government policies and criticize mistakes when they occur. The same applies during presidential candidate elections. Even outside election periods, students protest the deterioration and inadequacy of school facilities, and support or criticize statements from campus organizations.

Let me ask: How is what all these people are doing different from 'politics'? Is calling for Yoon Seok-yeol's impeachment free from the suspicion of being 'political' because there is 'social consensus'? Does taking interest in campus affairs and expressing opinions remain merely the natural behavior of 'pure students' with no relation to 'politics'? Unfortunately, all of this is indeed political action. Politics is the entirety of expressing opinions about the community one lives in and hoping to exert tangible or intangible influence. Despite everyone's daily life being political, the perception that politics can be confined to a mere courtyard cuts off all solidarity among citizens.

Let's Look Again at the Impure Plaza

The light sticks that have become part of rally culture in the plaza also illuminate exclusion and discrimination within the plaza. At impeachment rally sites, unorganized solidarity members extremely avoid being 'associated' with specific social movement organizations. We've witnessed ‘fan girls’ taking light stick imagery up in Rainbow Action's rally poster design up, signs saying "No meaning other than light sticks allowed" in the plaza, and countless individual flags.

These are all examples of solidarity members emphasizing that they are individuals and ordinary people 'not associated with any group.' While the reasons for emphasizing non-affiliation with specific groups may vary depending on context, there is clearly a gesture here refusing to be 'mobilized' for groups to express ideologies and engage in political activities beyond impeachment.

Those in the plaza are not using each other or being used by each other. We are all connected as subjects of struggle resisting the oppression of an undemocratic society. Last January, the Korea Disability Rights Solidarity (KDRS) participated in the 'Democracy Without Democracy at Dongduk' rally held in front of the National Assembly, expressing solidarity. KDRS activists showed solidarity with Dongduk Women's University's struggle without thinking about being 'used.' This was possible because it's impossible for KDRS to be used by Dongduk Women's University's struggle.

The meaning of light sticks and flags will also be co-opted by power once again if reduced and fixed to terms like 'fangirls,' 'pure citizens,' etc. Pursuing purity is itself blatant political rhetoric. Through arguments to become pure citizens who only care about 'issues to focus on,' diverse identities are completely erased and complex, multifaceted contexts evaporate.

Meanwhile, discrimination also occurs among those gathered in the plaza. The plaza that gathered to punish the insurrectionists becomes a place where jeers arise at queer-feminist activists' speeches and Japanese solidarity members' solidarity statements, and where food trucks exclude people based on 'nationality.' It's a place where non-human animals are summoned as language of insult, and misogynistic language about Kim Geon-hee and female politicians is uttered. The true face of this society that put Yoon Seok-yeol in the presidential seat is also reflected in the plaza. We cannot pretend not to know this. We must constantly reflect on problems within the plaza and act and dialogue to solve them. We must acknowledge that our bodies cannot be bleached to become 'non-political,' and that we are not clean either. That is our strength and the power to change society.

Our Daily Life Is the Plaza

The plaza makes visible the existence of queers, feminists, non-human animals, people with mental disabilities, sex workers, the poor, the sick, and marginalized and discriminated minorities in this society. A flawless plaza is meaningless and a non-existent illusion. Nevertheless, the narrow-mindedness of the plaza we witness is problematic, and the society we will create after driving out Yoon Seok-yeol will only arrive when we eliminate the various discrimination and exclusion revealed in the plaza.

'Selective' solidarity and maintaining distorted neutrality during the impeachment situation are not future options. Shouldn't we change everything that creates inequality, exploitation, and oppression?

When we gather strength for any issue, it is inherently political and almost inevitably becomes 'controversial.' But let's trust our connections and not be afraid. Let's actively participate in public forums that were avoided for being too political, and unhesitatingly stand together with minorities who fail to receive 'approval' for solidarity for being too subversive. Also, the plaza is not the only site of struggle. Some bodies can exist in the plaza and begin resistance from their own positions. And some bodies become resistance in themselves. Let's fiercely stand in solidarity so that our daily lives prevent only heterosexual male legal elite from dreaming of the presidency, from dreaming of outdated power lust, and from ever dreaming of insurrection again. Let's resist loudly in many places. Only then will boundaries connect crookedly, expand, and the liberation of all beings will come.

In his closing statement at the impeachment trial, defendant Yoon Seok-yul claimed that martial law was imposed to “protect the country.” The impeachment opposition calls out that protecting Yoon Seok-yeol is protecting Korea. Uncovering the election fraud and protecting the country are their main slogans. Whose country is their country?

The head of the Sejong Hotel branch is on a sit-in against the destruction of the union. Migrant workers of undocumented status are dying at industrial sites. Farmers' tractors, democracy in schools. Public housing projects blocked in the name of state power. The politics of erasing those who do not fit in at the top, the politics of trading rights for profits, and the politics of not remembering unjust deaths have created this country. Yoon Seok-yeol credits himself with “enlightening” the people, but what martial law revealed was that we were in the dark of night.

We gathered in the square in the darkness. We spoke and listened to each other's stories, comforted those who had been through the same darkness, and embraced those who had been through different darknesses. Through the impeachment, we united and built dreams together. Together with Yoon Seok-yeol, we promised to exorcise our darkness together.

Beyond the impeachment, those who dream of equality are desperately fighting for a noisy and cumbersome democracy. Freedom of assembly is a right that dictatorships have desperately suppressed, and it is the citizens who struggle against them that have opened the squares. Let's not forget that even the squares of the far right were forged in the soil of that struggle.

What are the anti-impeachment forces uniting for? It is cowardly if they are uniting to defend Yoon Seok-yeol's country. It is deceitful if we shout for democracy and yet shun Yoon Seok-yeol. With our strength, Yoon Seok-yeol will surely be dismissed. Let's move beyond the far-right incitement, hate and discriminatory language of Yoon Seok-yeol and Jeon Kwang-hoon. Let us move on to a better democracy.

        desc: `-Statement from the 2nd relay of the Ewha Rights Unit Solidarity for the Retirement of Yoon Seok-yul and Social Reform

Yoon Seok-yeol is anti-labor by his very existence. During Yoon's three years, labor policy and labor rights have regressed disastrously. In June 2022, Yoo Choe-an, a subcontractor worker at Daewoo Shipbuilding, welded himself into a 1-meter-wide by 1-meter-high prison cell to demand wage restoration and union recognition. When Yoo asked him, “We can't live like this, can we?” Yun did not answer, but rather, he told him to live and die. The Yun government, under the guise of labor-management rule of law, cracked down on the construction union, calling it a “gun,” and eventually forced Yang Hoedong, a construction union official, to set himself on fire and become his own body. All the construction union demanded was a place to work without dying. Yoon Seok-yeol later spoke of flexibility in working hours and announced a bill to revise the Labor Standards Act to allow for a 69-hour work week. Under the reform, it would be legal to work 21.5 hours a day.

The same deaths of different workers were repeated during Yoon's regime. In 2022, a worker in his 20s was sucked into a machine and killed at the SPC-affiliated SPL bakery. Ten months later, another pinching accident at the SPC-affiliated Shani bakery killed 50 workers. Numerous workers fell from steel beams and were crushed by steel blocks. Workers' cries of “I want to live like a human being” were also drowned out. Throughout his three years in power, Yun told those who worked to die at work, and those who refused to work to scatter on the streets.

The people who were pushed to the street met each other there. They stood as laborers, with their hearts on their sleeves, against capitalists with knives in their hands. Our square did not end here. The resignation of Yoon Seok-yeol is only the first step towards labor liberation. Workers live and move and practice. Workers are the ones who explain things until they are understood, the ones who greet guests with a smile no matter how hard it is. They are the ones who scrub hard with wire brushes and sandpaper to bring shine to rusted metal. As workers, we already know the way forward. Let's change the world in solidarity with the masters of history, the workers.

In 2023, 598 workers were killed in industrial accidents. How many more workers must be prevented from going to work. How many more workers will be killed by Yoon Seok-yeol, who colludes with evil capital. Why do workers have to fast, climb heights, and commit suicide so that they won't die at work. Let's bring out Yoon Seok-yeol and create a world where workers can work without worrying about tomorrow. Let's stand on the ground trampled by Yoon Seok-yeol and struggle for the guarantee of labor rights and the right to work for all workers. Let's stand in solidarity with the reinstatement of dismissed workers and the revision of Articles 2-3 of the Labor Law. Let's move towards the abolition of labor abuses and non-regular workers. Let's fight for spring against the blizzard that blows like bone dust. Let's chant slogans until the day of labor liberation. Our only way forward is a strong united struggle.

We Condemn the Release of Insurrection Leader Yoon Seok-yeol.
Let Us Gather Like Mountains for Yoon Seok-yeol's Immediate Dismissal!

Insurrection leader Yoon Seok-yeol ultimately escaped from prison by mobilizing legal technicalities. On March 7, the Seoul Central District Court decided to cancel Yoon Seok-yeol's detention, accepting the argument that prosecution occurred after the detention period had ended. On March 8, the prosecution released Yoon Seok-yeol despite opposition from the special investigation team regarding abandoning the right to immediate appeal. While citizens' basic human rights were ignored and curtailed under martial law, Yoon Seok-yeol, the leader of the insurrection, was released through unprecedented methods close to a prison break. This prosecution's decision to cancel detention is also silent pressure toward the Constitutional Court, telling them not to dismiss Yoon Seok-yeol.

If Yoon Seok-yeol returns, we cannot enjoy the same daily life as before. Yoon Seok-yeol is preparing for reinstatement to the presidency while inciting far-right forces. He may attempt a second martial law by mobilizing the military more quickly to make up for past 'mistakes.' Martial law unjustly makes not specific individuals but a wide range of citizens victims of state violence. We have witnessed struggles to seize democracy against dictatorship, such as the April 19 Revolution, May 18 Democratization Movement, and June Struggle, and the state violence that brutally suppressed them. The Constitutional Court must promptly dismiss Yoon Seok-yeol, the leader of insurrection. To accelerate the Constitutional Court's ruling and ensure a definitive unanimous dismissal verdict, we must gather more widely and more strongly.

Far-right groups opposing impeachment are expanding their influence in regions and university areas. They chant slogans like "Destroy Communism" while demanding the liquidation of insurrection forces and do not hesitate to use aggressive language and physical violence against those who recognize the values of democracy and diversity. As seen in the Western District Court riot and the mobilization of far-right YouTubers for declarations on current affairs in university areas, regardless of how the dismissal decision turns out, these groups will become major adversaries of democracy.

Let us show strong solidarity values against them. Let's engage in one-person protests and participate in rallies held every evening at 7 PM in Gwanghwamun Square. Let's raise our voices demanding dismissal and encourage rally participation. In Hangang-jin, countless people endured sub-zero weather calling for Yoon Seok-yeol's arrest. Re-detaining insurrection leader Yoon Seok-yeol will require greater power from citizens and workers. Just as we arrested Yoon Seok-yeol through the Hangang-jin struggle, let us gather like mountains to show that Yoon Seok-yeol's dismissal is our will.

We condemn the court that released Yoon Seok-yeol. We condemn the prosecution that abandoned immediate appeal.

Dismiss Yoon Seok-yeol immediately now. Let's seize democracy with our own strength!

On March 7, Yoon Seok-yeol's detention was revoked. Breaking with 70 years of practice, the decision to revoke his detention was made by calculating his detention period differently from criminal law textbooks and civil service exam questions. The citizens in the square were outraged and immediately appealed the decision, demanding that he be re-incarcerated, but the prosecutors refused. Prosecutor General Shim Woo-jeong said, “I made the decision with all my heart,” and defended the decision by saying, “It was in accordance with due process and principles to give up the appeal immediately.

Canceling Yoon Seok-yeol's detention is a second judicial rebellion
What is the point of revoking Yoon's detention when he is clearly guilty of rebellion? It disregards the elections and sovereign rights that have shaped South Korea in the past, and attempts to erase the democracy written in the blood of countless citizens. Does the judiciary not remember the people who were forced to stand at gunpoint in front of the National Assembly on the winter night of December 3 and fall under the terror of martial law? Those who pointed guns at citizens are now telling fellow citizens to point guns at each other. Should we have such anti-constitutional and anti-social voices in this society? This is a second mutiny of the judiciary, no different from the December 3 mutiny of the executive.

The Constitutional Court unanimously ordered the immediate dismissal of Yoon Seok-yeol.
Ewha Womans has been at the forefront of the university community since the December 3 uprising. From the 1809 Ewha Declaration, the first declaration of the 300, the second declaration of the 200, to the December 13 student general assembly's decision to impeach 2,657 Ewha students. Even after the impeachment motion was passed, students have continued to go to the square every week to demand Yoon's dismissal. The decision to dismiss Yoon Seok-yeol is the demand of Ewha students and the demand of the people. The Constitutional Court unanimously ruled that Yoon should be dismissed immediately. Let's defend the history of democracy and liberation until the moment of Yoon's dismissal.

One, the Constitutional Court should unanimously dismiss Yoon Seok-yeol immediately.
One, Condemn the revocation of Yoon Seok-yeol's detention for rebellion

As the slogan of Seoul Women's University says, “We are stronger than me.”

The “I,” the right-wing that exists as an individual, has been silent for a long time.

Today, “we” cry out for freedom to live, and we condemn the unjust impeachment attempt against President Yoon Seok-yul in defense of Korea's liberal democracy and women's rights.

Martial law was a necessary measure to thoroughly investigate the fraudulent election. Amid serious security concerns at the Election Commission and the Supreme Court's acquiescence to the fraud, the truth could not be revealed through conventional judicial processes alone. President Yun was determined to break the corrupt judicial cartel and safeguard liberal democracy.

Fraud is not just a domestic issue, but part of China's hybrid warfare strategy. South Korea risks being isolated in the international community if it is labeled as a war criminal for fraudulent elections, which would lead to the collapse of the trilateral trilateral system. President Yoon's martial law was a necessary option to prevent South Korea from becoming a puppet of the CCP.

Anti-state forces, including the Democratic Party of Korea, have been acting on behalf of China's interests and have not hesitated to jeopardize national security: undermining the fairness of elections, taking over the judiciary, destroying the rule of law, and transforming South Korea into a pro-Chinese state. Yun's martial law and attempts to illegally impeach President Yun Suk-yol for defending liberal democracy are clear acts of insurrection.

The right-wing regime has actually protected women's human rights, ensuring their safety and opportunities through laws and institutions, while the left has hypocritically used women's human rights as a political tool. We will no longer be used by the left to hold women's human rights hostage.

“We,” the women of the right wing of Seoul Women's University, an organization founded to practice gender equality in the Christian spirit, declare today as defenders of liberal democracy.

One, we oppose the unjust impeachment of President Yoon Seok-yul.
One, we demand a full investigation into the election fraud allegations.
One, we condemn the anti-national behavior of the pro-China cartel in favor of the Democratic Party of Korea.
One, we pledge to defend women's freedom and rights, the rule of law and liberal democracy in Korea to the end.

Along with the publication, announcing that the 29th Student Government Emergency Committee inherits the position of the 28th Student Government Emergency Committee (the <28th Student Government Emergency Committee Declaration on Current Affairs> published on December 7, 2024)

Art is the last bastion that preserves humanity when society collapses, and it is a movement that reflects and communicates with the world. As artists, we have a calling to pursue freedom and coexistence, not oppression and tyranny of power. Through the examples of artists who came before us, we know that art functions as a ray of light in this country, and we know that this light must exist within us who look toward and pursue that light. This is a condemnation of the attempt to construct a system that makes any kind of equal discussion, free expression, or social solidarity and trust impossible, before it is a political discussion. Art does not remain silent. Art does not yield to the oppression of power.

K-ARTS students, led by the General Assembly and Emergency Committee, follow constitutional order and democratic justice rather than any particular political view. Therefore, we inherit the position of the K-ARTS 28th Student Government Emergency Committee that criticized the Yoon Seok-yeol government's martial law incident.

        desc: `- Summary of Women's Universities Coalition Anti-Impeachment Declaration Statement -

For women in South Korea in 2025, conservative parties are seen as 'misogynistic' parties. For most women, the current ruling party is absolutely unsupportable, and the perception that the Democratic Party is truly the party for women is deeply ingrained in their minds. But what is the reality?

The Democratic Party outwardly advocates for women's protection, but the reality is different. They hindered drug and deepfake investigations by cutting police special activity funds, and former emergency committee chairperson Park Ji-hyeon, who criticized internal sexual crimes, was expelled. The Democratic Party advocates for women's rights but actually remains silent in the face of sexual crimes. Furthermore, the Democratic Party has long colluded with communist forces, condoning spies' leakage of military secrets, and led impeachment declarations with pro-China and pro-North Korea figures. Has the Democratic Party not already become one body with the Chinese Communist Party?

In reality, women under communist systems are thoroughly violated. China perpetrates forced contraception and sexual violence against Uyghur women, and North Korean women are exploited without even understanding the concept of sexual crimes. North Korean defector women are sold to China's sex trafficking market, and in KakaoTalk, which has Chinese influence, even the term 'women's rights' is banned.

In contrast, conservative party presidents have implemented genuine policies for women. First President Syngman Rhee guaranteed women's suffrage and educational rights, and President Park Geun-hye, the first female president, led STEM female talent development and strengthened punishment for sex offenders. However, the left is erasing the existence of conservative women they fear most through 'intentional exclusion,' 'mockery,' and 'stigmatization.' Even at this moment, students in women's universities who oppose impeachment are receiving threats of assault, intimidation, and doxxing, but the left and mainstream media turn a blind eye to this.

We must win in the current hybrid war and overcome the crisis of our nation being bound by communist chains. Only by protecting liberal democracy can left and right maintain balance, listen to each other, debate, and develop this society. We hope that numerous students already facing accusations of being far-right and numerous students remaining as 'conservatives' will boldly speak the truth, and we earnestly hope for a society where mutual criticism, not condemnation, is free.

South Korean women must now break away from the perception that 'only leftist parties are for women.' And the women's university coalition students who defend liberal democracy declare:

One, we oppose the illegal impeachment of President Yoon Seok-yeol.

One, we demand fair investigation of the Election Commission, which has signs of election fraud.

One, we condemn the anti-state activities of the pro-China, pro-North Korea cartel.

One, we condemn the Democratic Party's insurrectionary acts of fabricating evidence to frame the president as an insurrectionist.

One, we will protect women's freedom and rights, and the rule of law and liberal democracy of the Republic of Korea.

        desc: `March 27th, Let's Join the General Strike That Will Change the World

The time for patience is over. We can wait no longer. The lives of the people remain stuck on the night of December 3rd last year when Yoon Seok-yeol declared martial law. Dawn has not broken even though dawn has come, the sun has not set even though the sun has passed, and the weather has not warmed even though the season has changed. We have yet to witness the miserable end of the Yoon Seok-yeol regime that engaged in discrimination, hatred, oppression, anti-democracy, and harmful reforms, ultimately ordering "elimination" and attempting dictatorship.

We can no longer wait for the Constitutional Court's timeline. This is not a matter of patience. This is a matter of survival. While the Constitutional Court indefinitely drags out the timing of Yoon Seok-yeol's dismissal ruling, the people's economy has reached ruin and democracy is being devastatingly damaged. While the Constitutional Court rejected the impeachment of insurrection collaborator Han Duck-soo, the people standing in the plaza were betrayed once again. Our lives are still under threat. We can no longer just watch the hesitating and wavering Constitutional Court. Further patience is impossible.

Korean society has advanced through the blood and resistance of the people and workers. Even in the unprecedented moment when Yoon Seok-yeol tried to "eliminate" and "collect" us by mobilizing the military, we fiercely resisted and protected our daily lives. We continued to go out to the streets and plazas. This time too, we will surely advance. Through our resistance, we will surely face the miserable end of this terrible regime.

On March 27th, let's stop work and studies and go to the plaza. When workers stop, the world stops. Let us, who make the world turn, show the power to stop the world. Let's present terrible despair to Yoon Seok-yeol, who may be harboring a glimmer of hope at this moment. Let's show the pressure of workers and people to the hesitating and wavering Constitutional Court. Let's struggle so that dawn can finally break, the sun can finally set, and the weather can finally warm.

Sungkonghoe University Labor-Student Solidarity 'Gasi' will struggle sharply toward the end of the Yoon Seok-yeol regime and toward the new world that will finally come. We will seize our safe daily lives. "Finally we shall go, carrying the flags of freedom, equality, and liberation." On March 27th, let's stop work and all gather together in the plaza.

        desc: `Joint Statement by 29 Youth and Student Organizations Demanding Social Transformation

Today, the Constitutional Court unanimously accepted the impeachment motion against Yoon Suk-yeol. Delaying tactics such as postponing the ruling and failing to appoint Constitutional Court justices did not work. Even the longest deliberation period in history, dragged out for 111 days, could not ignore the voices of millions of citizens who filled the squares. While it is regrettable that we could only remove this coup attempt perpetrator who plotted insurrection and pointed guns at citizens through the National Assembly and Constitutional Court, we, the collective youth and student organizations, still welcome the Constitutional Court's belated decision to accept the impeachment.

The Yoon Suk-yeol regime has ended, but our struggle has not ended. No, it has only just begun. In a society where we must struggle desperately to remove the ringleader of insurrection, where approximately 2,000 workers are driven to death annually by capitalist violence, where structural gender discrimination and oppression of sexual minorities are rampant, where workers must climb iron towers dozens of meters high alone to demand an end to labor oppression, where students have been fighting for months for campus democracy against misogyny, where disabled people are forcibly suppressed and punished simply for trying to take the subway, where teachers who raise issues about campus sexual violence are dismissed and citizens who show solidarity are arrested, where nature is exploited and destroyed for profit, where weapons are exported to the war criminal state of Israel that massacres Palestinians, and where demands for social progress are suppressed under the outdated "pro-North Korea" frame—we have only brought down one president.

In the world we will meet after impeachment, we must change social structures to fight against all oppression and exploitation. Beyond removing the president, we must liquidate the remnants of insurrection, enact anti-discrimination laws, and revise Articles 2 and 3 of the Trade Union Act. We must abolish irregular employment and drastically raise the minimum wage to secure workers' and people's right to survival. We must break down structural gender discrimination and establish the principle of equal pay for equal work. We must create progressive politics that transcends the conservative two-party system. We must not stop here but overturn the Sixth Republic system itself, which has produced two failed presidents. While one mistake might be coincidental, a second failure is a structural problem.

During the Park Geun-hye ouster movement, attempts to postpone fundamental change until after impeachment and limit square politics to within the parliament created today's President Yoon Suk-yeol. The Moon Jae-in government, which promised to "clear accumulated evils," could not escape the system's limitations, and promises such as zero irregular workers in the public sector and a 10,000 won minimum wage era were ultimately not kept. The failure of the Moon Jae-in government's promised clearing of accumulated evils and prosecution reform led to the rise of Prosecutor General Yoon Suk-yeol. Now that square democracy has returned, we must not repeat the same mistakes.

Those who fear change will say, as they always do, that the time is not yet right. However, all transformation is premature. We simply seize premature change through struggle. Over the past four months, the squares have built networks of struggling people. Citizens who took to the squares calling for impeachment soon extended solidarity to the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the Korean Peasants League, the Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination, Dongduk Women's University, Palestine, the Sejong Hotel and Geotong Gojo Shipbuilding Subcontract Branch sit-ins, and teacher Ji Hye-bok. In the process of opposing the far-right relay situation declarations within universities, solidarity among student movement organizations was also created. Therefore, now is the time to move beyond impeachment toward social transformation, beyond discrimination and hatred toward solidarity, beyond exploitation toward equality. Let us move past hollow democracy to seize people's power. We, the 29 youth and student organizations, resolve to continue this struggle together.

        desc: `At 11:22 AM on April 4, 2025, the respondent Yoon Suk-yeol was dismissed from office.

Citizens prevented martial law through their struggle and solidarity. In the cold winter, citizens took to the streets demanding dismissal. Thus winter became spring. Citizens did not leave the squares, and did not abandon cruel democracy.

There were people who fought without yielding to discrimination. People who rushed forward without hesitation in the face of enormous power created today's dismissal. Those discriminated against in life, those for whom daily life was martial law, struggled in the squares to make their existence known, to raise their voices. They overcame the sharp winds with each other's warmth and have struggled to the end, and will continue to struggle.

After the dismissal, we stand before an end that is also a new beginning.

Metal Workers' Union comrade Kim Hyung-su, comrade Ko Jin-su dismissed from Sejong Hotel, and comrades Park Jung-hye and So Hyun-suk from Optical Hi-tech struggle at heights for labor rights. The Korea Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination struggles for dignity every morning. Factory workers must labor with their lives as collateral. Discrimination against women, disabled people, the elderly, sexual minorities, non-humans, and the poor still runs rampant.

Therefore, Yoon Suk-yeol's dismissal cannot lead to the end of all struggles. If we confirmed in the squares that we are 'together,' now is the time to live 'together.' We must face the rusted system and society, and earnestly contemplate the 'world we will meet again.' Even if we are afraid and afraid again, we must raise our voices.

We promise:
We will not leave the squares.
We will stand in solidarity.
Thus we will love and heal.

But we do not forget.

We do not forget the chilling terror of helicopter sounds that surrounded the National Assembly on December 3rd.

We do not forget the cold of Namtaeryeong.

We do not forget the anger of Hangangjin.

We do not forget the grip of state violence that brutally seized workers, students, women, sexual minorities, disabled people, and citizens.

From December 3rd to April 4th, we do not forget the workers who consistently failed to return home—one or two each day. We do not forget Yang Hoe-dong, the martyr who fell under the slander and oppression of being labeled "violent construction" during the Yoon Suk-yeol regime, and the Construction Workers' Union.

We do not forget our comrades at Korea Optical, Hanwha Ocean, and Sejong Hotel who still cannot come down from their high-altitude protests.

We do not forget the shamelessness of deploying police wearing vests with "Korean Confederation of Trade Unions" written on them like props to prepare for protest suppression. We do not forget the long and humiliating wait we had to endure with anxious hearts just to hear an utterly obvious verdict—made up of words already repeated dozens and hundreds of times in the squares—repeated once more solely in the name of the Constitutional Court.

But we did not remain idle.

Through the long four months, until snow melted and flowers bloomed on campus, Ewha Womans University—where the Student Council, Central Steering Committee, campus autonomous units and rights organizations, and students joined forces to passionately participate in and show solidarity through situation declarations, relay wall newspapers, student assemblies, and general strike solidarity class boycotts—does not disappear. It must not disappear. The campus autonomy of Ewha, which in the 1980s led the struggle for democratization without shame to the name "liberation," and which carries the legacy of contributing to Park Geun-hye's ouster in 2016, is connected to the pulse of the entire Republic of Korea. Attempting to exclude this is as futile as trying to prevent winds blowing from outside campus from blowing inside campus. It is merely the desperate struggle to erase the past and turn back the tide of history.

Insurrection alone does not justify dismissal. Martial law alone does not justify struggle.

We know that every attempt to oppress workers and the people is a small insurrection, a small martial law against Korean democracy. We illuminated darkness with light. Now let us embrace darkness and move toward light.

Let us uproot insurrection sympathizers until they never again dare to raise their voices,

Let us name the world we will meet again as belonging to workers, farmers, students, and all those who have been dispossessed.

Only one storm has passed. Let us struggle more firmly like rocks, more vigorously, more ardently.

Let us fight against dismissals, discrimination, inequality, hatred, and capitalism and neoliberalism that pursue money and power over human lives.

Order. The respondent President Yoon Suk-yeol is dismissed from office.

Order. We reject the conclusion that all judgment has ended.

On May 1st, Labor Day, let us gather once more in the squares, let us take the lead in the name of youth and students and raise the flag of liberation even higher. Will we remain as markers, or will we become cornerstones?

We pledge to continue the struggle to end all insurrection

"The time is now 11:22 AM. Order: The respondent President Yoon Suk-yeol is dismissed from office."

We Welcome the Constitutional Court's Impeachment Ruling

At 11:22 AM on April 4, 2025, the Constitutional Court unanimously ruled to dismiss respondent President Yoon Suk-yeol from office. We welcome with open arms the Constitutional Court's decision that responded 8-0 to the fervor of the squares. Those of us who gathered in the squares daily since the martial law declaration on December 3rd have finally brought down insurrection ringleader Yoon Suk-yeol and witnessed the moment when democracy was restored. We who have defended the squares looked into each other's eyes, exchanged greetings, and cheered. The candles in the squares have triumphed once again.

While we welcome the Constitutional Court's impeachment ruling, we express regret that the crisis of democracy has spread uncontrollably in the meantime. This ruling, delivered 123 days after Yoon Suk-yeol declared emergency martial law, is like closing the barn door after the horse has bolted. The dismissal of insurrection ringleader Yoon Suk-yeol is a natural result, but the process was excessively delayed. During this time, politics became extremely polarized, and far-right forces rallied to incite social chaos. Citizens had to continue their fight for survival amid economic recession and soaring prices.

Let Us Ride This Momentum to End All Insurrection

Yoon Suk-yeol's dismissal from the presidency does not mean insurrection has ended. The cabinet members appointed by Yoon Suk-yeol are still boldly maintaining their positions, and the insurrectionist party People Power Party, which has become a rallying point for the far-right, continues to persist shamelessly without dissolution. Even now, far-right extremists who defend insurrection are threatening democratic citizens in the streets and committing violence, while the People Power Party incites these violent acts. It is time to catch our breath and rise up in struggle once again to end all insurrection and rebuild the democracy they destroyed through the direct politics of youth, students, workers, and citizens.

Let Us Build a New World with the Very Force That Ended Insurrection

Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment is not an end but a beginning. This precious victory we achieved together is proof that youth, students, workers, and citizens united as one to defend democracy, and evidence that we ourselves can create a better future. We must ride the momentum of this victory to fundamentally transform the structures of discrimination, oppression, and inequality that have taken root in Korean society. We have only just taken the first step on the journey toward a society where labor is respected, where there is no discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation, and where youth can embrace hope and dream of the future.

This united force that fought against the threats of insurrection and the far-right is our most powerful weapon and hope. Now we must move further toward an equal society where all citizens are guaranteed dignity and rights, a hopeful society where young people's dreams are not frustrated, and a solidarity society where the weak and minorities are not discriminated against. The Chungbuk National University Student Joint Action for Yoon Suk-yeol's Ouster will join this path toward democracy and an equal society through struggle and solidarity.

On April 4, 2025, the day our first hope was realized

        desc: `On April 4, 2025, Yun Seok-yeol was removed from the presidency. For 123 days, citizens continued to take to the streets and squares to demand his removal. Their refusal to remain silent in the face of injustice led to his removal.

For four months, the square was both a place of struggle and a place of learning. From the National Assembly on December 3 to the Constitutional Court on April 4, the square was filled with countless faces each time. As more and more people joined the ranks of the movement for dismissal and equality, the square grew wider as different voices mingled. It was not only Yoon's case that resonated in the square, but many other voices, voices that had been silenced, voices that had been marginalized and attacked, voices that had been marginalized and attacked.

The square was a space where we could not only 'read' about social issues, but also face-to-face and communicate with those who were struggling. We connected and felt each other's presence as members of society. We met the struggles of Dongdeok Women's University and the Democratic Trade Union Confederation, which have been vilified by the media and the political establishment. We learned about the unfamiliar sit-ins and the struggle for the reinstatement of teacher Ji-bok Choi. I also learned about the struggle of semiconductor workers, the semiconductor special law, and the specialized vocational high school labor union, which have been ongoing for a long time but have not been highlighted. The issues gathered in the square became ours.

Over the past four months, there has been more than just this vocal struggle and determined chanting in the square. As the time spent in the square grew longer, the culture of the square blossomed, bringing people together who would never have met before. Some came out with their most precious light, their batons, and lit up the night sky, while their riders carried banners with their stories and hopes in the wind. Others brought musical instruments and became street musicians. Rushing to where solidarity was needed, they banded together in the name of Comrade Wasp. The edges of the struggle are sharp and can wear us down. But when the flags, the songs, and the loved ones came together, the struggle was no longer distant and arduous. The struggle was close to us.

We still have work to do. When the fight is over and we are told to return to “normal life,” some people feel lonely. There are comrades for whom the struggle has become a daily routine. People with disabilities fighting for the right to mobility, workers fighting against unfair dismissal at Sejong Hotel, Ms. Jeong Ji-bok, a public whistleblower against sexual violence, optical workers demanding job succession in a burned factory, the poor, sex workers in Yongjugol, Miari, farmers, we must stand with them in their struggle.

There are people who face physical and social constraints that make it difficult for them to be in the public square. People who live from one day to the next, workers who have to defend their jobs, people who live in non-metropolitan areas, people who do care work at home. People who dream of a better world but can't make it happen. The square was a place that required certain conditions: health, physical strength, and economic conditions. The square needs to be bigger, and it needs to strive to include more people. We need to create an environment where everyone can participate, and we need to think together about how to realize democracy within our own circumstances.

At the same time, we need to fight distrust and cynicism about politics. There are those who say that politics is not their business, that martial law is unjust, and that social reform is a burden because it is a political demand. But if we don't look for politics, it will find us. Just like the night of martial law. Martial law was an event that threatened everyone living in Korean society. We are all parties to politics. When we care about our own and others' living conditions, we can create a better society.

In martial law, we saw the specter of dictatorship in the clearest way, but the people came out to the square and took change into their own hands. Politics is not a power struggle of the powerful. It is the invention of unimaginable solidarity, the overthrow of discrimination and oppression through solidarity. Let's make a violent political spring bloom. Just like the pro-democracy protests in April, May, and June, we fought by candlelight once again in December. Let's get rid of the cynicism that politics is not worth talking about, that it's just a fight. So far, we have been rushing to restore order with the wave, but the important thing is to change the order itself, to constantly rebel against it.

The joy of the break will be the foundation for the struggle ahead. We met in the square,
and we will continue to meet in the streets. The achievements of the square do not end with regime change. The victory of the square is the meeting of our different selves. Let's move forward together, flags flying, singing.
