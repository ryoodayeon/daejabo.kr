        barely a day after this declaration was posted, the nation was thrown into chaos.
        
        At 22:00 on December 3, 2024, Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law,  
        claiming it was to “eradicate subversive anti-state forces.”  
        Immediately, armed soldiers broke windows and stormed the National Assembly, and helicopters flew over Yeouido. Soldiers aimed their guns at citizens gathered at the Assembly. The Martial Law Command issued Proclamation No. 1, stating that “violators of the proclamation will be dealt with under martial law,” effectively placing the lives of citizens on the chopping block. This hasty martial law declaration, made without notifying the National Assembly, not only violated Article 77 of the Constitution but also sought to shut down the National Assembly,  
        clearly shaking the foundations of liberal democracy.
        
        “I witness death taking one step closer to me every day.”  
        Workers die on the job, isolated performers die on lonely stages,  
        and now citizens face death from the approaching flames, even inside their own homes.
        
        “We saw the National Assembly Station, where the National Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination has long fought against discrimination,  become a battleground against Yoon Suk-yeol’s martial law.”
        
        “And the arrows of fear and violence shoot in all directions.”  
        
        “The Yoon administration is violating freedom of expression,  
        which is the premise and condition of democracy.”  
        
        After declaring martial law, the government banned the press, publications, assemblies, political activity, and strikes. For the president to call the state a “den of national crime” is absurd. It is Yoon Suk-yeol himself who is trampling on citizens’ freedoms and threatening democracy today.  
        
        “We can no longer tolerate this regime’s behavior,  
        which destroys public safety and solidarity just to maintain its own privileges.”
        
        Gather your strength and bring Yoon down. Until Yoon steps down from the presidency and is punished for gambling away the lives of all citizens in an instant, we must press forward. We have nothing to listen to. To build a society where no one is carelessly excluded or killed, we, the survivors, will reclaim power together with all living beings. For the society we envision, let us wage an urgent struggle. 
        
        The irresponsible Yoon Suk-yeol, who will destroy the nation for his own gain, must resign immediately!

The university is the symbol of defiance and freedom.`,
        desc: `We stand today on the proud history of democratic progress, led 64 years ago by the Seoul National University student revolution.  

        Now, as this same history of democratization faces sudden destruction, the Korea University Student Council believes we must raise a voice worthy of the true stature of a university.
        
        On December 3, President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law nationwide. In a modern democratic society, a unitary system cannot exist in any “sustainable” form, yet Yoon’s martial law declares the final conclusion of such a system and signals the use of military force within campuses through the Martial Law Command. Proclamation No. 1 even states, “We will root out the anti-state forces lurking within free South Korea.”
        
        We cannot forget. Who are these so-called anti-state forces who sought to trample on our autonomy? Their networks were not only external. Inside too, academic autonomy and scholarly democracy, which freely gather and deliver the will of members, have always been suppressed.. That was what they—the anti-state forces—truly feared: the realization of genuine democracy. Who, after all, are these “forces”?
        
        The norms of free autonomy are a unified constitutional ideology,  
        and through this, students hold legitimate authority over all matters within the university. As the subjects who built student society, we have a sense of ownership, and as members of society, we respect the Constitution and bear the duty to defend it.  
        
        We, the university students, to protect the rights of free autonomy,  
        cannot obey any orders that infringe on the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association.  
        We already hold the right to refuse dictatorship and oppression.
        
        Indeed, we live in an age of democracy. We rose up resolutely from the darkest oppression of the past. What we must never let go of are freedom and justice. On these values, we must now take firm steps forward toward democracy. The orders of martial law hold no binding force over university members with democratic freedom. Our autonomous rights surpass such commands.
        
        We are the youth of free normative autonomy. Let us consciously and always defend our rights to freedom and democratic justice. We can take to the streets for learning, democracy, freedom, and justice. We are not merely members of the university—we are future agents, the sovereign people of society, and we must now raise our voices. We will stand and fight to the very end against unjust oppression.
        
        So that this democratic republic may truly realize its name in liberal democracy, our “democratized university comrades” join in one loud chorus, as drawn by our predecessors and as the most realistic, reasonable, and historically necessary.
        
        One, completely withdraw the martial law and emergency orders.  
        One, we will not yield to force.  
        One, we will defend the rights of autonomy and the justice of democracy.
        
        Burn down the shackles of oppression!

        5. On December 4, 2024, at 4:20 a.m., Yoon gave a national address on lifting martial law but did not acknowledge his wrongdoing, only stating, “Cease your reckless hopes of restoring the nation’s framework with the instinct to defend against the impeachment and lynching of the leftists.”
        
        Kodae Munhwa (Korea University Culture Editorial) opposes President Yoon’s unconstitutional, illegal, and anti-national declaration of martial law. Yoon is an insurrectionist who attempted to restore state power through unconstitutional martial law.
        
        Martial law is nothing more than a loyalist coup. Yoon’s so-called martial law, like other military martial laws, is an act to bind the people who hold true sovereignty and is an attempt to shake the very foundation of democracy.
        
        Yoon, under the guise of “defending liberal democracy,” activates martial law but refuses to support the legitimate functioning of the National Assembly. Who, then, is being oppressed and who is being liberated? After his speech, the nation and its people must immediately decide and judge—not whether the “leftists” or “anti-state forces” are the problem, but whether Yoon Suk-yeol himself is.

We must never forget the martial law we have lived through and endured. Countless citizens died under the pretext of “national security,” victims of state violence.
        
        Kodae Munhwa will stand at the forefront against dictatorship. In May 1980 in Gwangju, and in June 1987 across the country, countless citizens stained history with their blood to bring about change.

        desc: `Last night, it became clear that we witnessed the fall of liberal democracy.  Around 22:20 on December 3, 2024, we faced the first martial law in 45 years. President Yoon announced through an emergency briefing that he was declaring martial law to “eradicate the anti-state forces” that cruelly destroy the freedom and happiness of the people, claiming it was to defend the liberal constitutional order.

        Article 77, Section 1 of the Constitution specifies that “in times of war, armed conflict, or comparable national emergencies, when necessary for military reasons or to maintain public order and safety,” martial law may be declared.  
        
        However, on the night of December 3, there was no national emergency threatening the state’s existence, and therefore, the declaration of martial law without constitutional grounds clearly constituted a crime against constitutional order.  
        
        President Yoon must stop his arrogance and tyranny and take strict responsibility for this martial law declaration.  
        
        When declaring martial law, the Constitution requires notifying the National Assembly and immediately following the will of the people; the decision to dissolve a duly elected parliament cannot be tolerated.  
        Declaring martial law under the guise of protecting constitutional order ultimately leads to the collapse of liberal democracy. It is utterly tragic to witness the suppression of freedom of the press and publication, and the restriction of freedoms of assembly and association—a truly undemocratic act.
        
        The Sogang University Student Council, guided by its charter’s preamble to uphold human dignity, justice, and love, and committed to building a democratic society, reaffirms the sacrifices of our proud predecessors.  
        We act on this commitment, expressing deep anger and concern at President Yoon’s delusions and actions.  
        
        This is an act that tramples on the struggles, efforts, and sacrifices of countless people who have fought to protect democracy, fundamentally denying the constitutional principle of popular sovereignty.  
        Democracy is the foundation of governance, and the delegation of sovereign power cannot be fulfilled without accountability.  
        Even if our voice is but a faint whisper, Sogang’s call for justice and freedom will resonate.  
        
        We strongly condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol’s actions, which, under the name of martial law, undermine constitutional values, trample on the rights of the people, and drag our society into ruin.

        Yoon stated, “We are declaring martial law with the resolute will of the armed forces to confront anti-state forces that paralyze the essential functions of the state and seek to collapse the liberal democratic constitutional order.”
        
        This declaration of martial law is clearly an act of trampling on South Korea’s liberal democratic constitutional order. Yoon’s declaration violates Article 77, Section 1 of the Constitution and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Martial Law Act. Beyond factional lines, Yoon’s martial law tramples on the people’s lives and the liberal democratic order, making it a grave anti-state action that dismisses institutional opinions through political trickery.  
        His claim that martial law would restore liberal democracy instead drags the constitutional order into the abyss of oblivion.
        
        What is even more tragic is that this anti-democratic martial law threatens and even self-destructs our academic community. By decree, it restricts freedoms of the press, publication, assembly, and association, and fails to respect our halls of learning, which should thrive on free criticism and debate. We will never sit idly by as darkness casts over the torch of truth. With our voices, we will reignite the spark.
        
        May our will, which lights the path for the nation, never be dulled; may the democratic steps we take not crumble under anti-democratic acts.

However, last night’s arbitrary declaration of martial law, the proclamations issued by the Martial Law Command, and the entry of martial forces to blockade the National Assembly were clearly extreme anti-constitutional coup actions.  
        The Korean Constitution mandates that the president must notify the National Assembly when declaring martial law and must follow procedural steps grounded in constitutional and emergency justifications.

        destroyed the rights to assembly, protest, and demonstration, and infringed on freedom of the press and publication.
        
        One, Yoon Suk-yeol must clearly explain to the people the reasons for declaring martial law and apologize for the series of measures and decisions taken thereafter.
        
        One, the government must acknowledge the unconstitutionality of the martial law situation and establish and implement measures to restore national order.

        President Yoon claimed he was declaring martial law to defend liberal democracy and protect the safety of the people against anti-state forces threatening regime overthrow. However, both the procedures and content of this declaration violated the Constitution, making it an undeniably anti-democratic act.
        
        Furthermore, the proclamations issued under martial law restricted citizens’ basic rights, suppressing the political freedoms that democratic citizens should naturally enjoy. They controlled the press and publication, banned strikes and assemblies, and authorized the immediate arrest of any citizen opposing martial law.  
        
        Such proclamations, issued in 2024, are hard to believe belong in this era.  
        If martial law has been lifted by a National Assembly resolution, President Yoon’s ignoring of the constitutional principle that “all power comes from the people” is clear.
        
        Yet, President Yoon continues to remain in office. There is no justification for systematizing martial law and standing before representatives. The reckless and irresponsible words of one powerholder have caused severe damage across politics, society, the economy, and healthcare.

        Around 10:00 p.m. on December 3, 2024, President Yoon declared martial law across South Korea. Following this, the Martial Law Command issued Proclamation No. 1, banning all political activities by the National Assembly, local councils, political parties, assemblies, and protests,  
        and restricting all press and publication freedoms.  
        
        Martial law is a measure only permitted under extremely limited circumstances, such as wartime, armed conflict, or comparable national emergencies as defined by the Constitution. However, President Yoon declared it without meeting any such conditions. This martial law is an anti-constitutional outrage that can never be tolerated.
        
        In a democratic society, the most important means is consensus,  
        and the use of any form of violence to threaten community members is utterly rejected by democracy. Yet the commander-in-chief, who should protect the freedoms and rights of the people, personally declared martial law, aimed guns at the people, and issued a proclamation banning all political associations and press freedoms. This is an unjustifiable, anti-democratic act. Thus, we define President Yoon’s martial law measures as a severe betrayal of democracy.
        
        Nonetheless, the reason this martial law crisis did not escalate into bloodshed or worse was thanks to countless citizens who spoke out with anger and courage, and thanks to the judiciary, which promptly pointed out the martial law’s problems and checked the ruling party’s abuses.  
        This was an event where we confirmed that even when a deviant power makes the wrong judgment, mature citizens can stop it and uphold the values of democracy.  
        
        As members of the future generation seeking truth and liberty at a university, the Yonsei University Student Council will continue to recognize the gravity of this incident and demand accountability from President Yoon and all involved.
        
        We remember the voices of students and citizens that rang out across our campus and in the squares during June 1987. The Yonsei University Student Council empathizes with the urgency of once again raising a determined voice to defend the democracy of South Korea.  
        
        We will stand at the forefront of justice in any critical moment,  
        and we will actively act to protect the values of democracy and the Constitution.

박한수 계엄사령관은 포고령을 통해 “사회혼란을 조장하는 파업, 태업, 집회행위를 금한다”고 말한다. 직업행위가, 태업이, 파업이 사회혼란을 조장하는가? 광장의 시민들이 박한수에게 묻는다. 국회의 국회의원들이, 집안의 집안민이, 거리에서 시전을 지키는 한국인이 묻는다. 윤석열 대통령의 눈에 무엇이 반국가적 범죄로 비치는지 묻는다. 허위선동세력? 위험세력? 윤석열 대통령이 믿고 있는 그 ‘질서’는 무엇인가? 그들은 어떤 ‘사회혼란’을 진압하고 대체 어디서 그들의 ‘질서’를 찾고자 했는가?

우린 이미 역사 속에서 손쉽게 답을 보았다. 1980년 5월 광주의 열사들에서 보았다. 1979년의 터벅터벅 군드러진 발에서, 1987년 6월의 연세대 정문에서, 2015년 을밀대 리젠트 농민에게서도 보았다. 계엄을 선포하고, 권력을 두려워하고, 장갑차로 밀어붙이고, 창문을 부수고, 시민에게 총구를 들이밀어 압을 수 있는 질서라면 그런 질서 따위 필요 없다. 당신들의 질서는 이미 지지될 필요 없다. 시민의 뜻에 없는 권력은 그저 폭력일 뿐이다.

그럼에도 그 질서를 폭력으로 환원하겠다면 우린 저항할 것이다. 연세대 비정규직 공동대책회의 일원으로서 차별받는 학내, 청소수자, 이방인, 성적 소수자, 여성 연대인, 여전히 동체의 일부로서 비판 소수자, 시설관리노동자, 비정규직 및 강사 연대한다. 궁극의 권력은 시민의 것이다. 우린 그 권력을 지키는 시민으로서 저항하겠다. 시민으로서 저항하겠다. 이 의무를 국가가 사회 혼란이라 한다면 우리는 마땅히 혼란이 되어 시민을 옥죄고, 자유를 파괴하고, 생명을 위협하는 질서에 맞서리라.

윤석열 대통령에게 요구한다.

명분 없는 계엄으로 국민을 짓밟은 것을 당장 사죄하라.  
계엄의 진행 과정과 책임소재를 명명백백히 규명하라.  
이 모든 사태에 책임을 지고 즉각 대통령에서 하야하라.

헌법 제77조에 따른 계엄령은 국가가 전시나 사변, 혹은 이에 준하는 절체절명의 위기 상황에서만 발동될 수 있는 최후의 수단이다. 이는 국민의 생명과 국가의 존립을 위한 극히 제한적인 조치로, 그 어떤 상황에서도 남용되어서는 안 된다. 그러나 이번 계엄령 시도가 과연 이러한 요건을 충족했는가? 우리는 단호히 ‘아니오’라 답한다. 이번 시도는 헌법 정신과 민주적 가치를 정면으로 부정한 것이며, 과거 권위주의 정권 시절 국민의 권리를 억압하기 위해 사용되었던 폭력적 수단을 떠올리게 한다.

윤석열 대통령의 계엄령 발동 시도는 범죄적이며 민주주의에 대한 노골적이고도 중대한 도전이다. 법령을 수호해야 할 국가 권력이 오히려 국민의 자유를 짓밟고, 자신들의 권력을 유지하기 위해 불법적 수단을 동원하려 했다는 점에서 이는 명백한 반헌법적 행위다. 우리는 계엄령 철회의 문제가 아니라, 헌법과 국기의 기반을 침해하려 한 모든 시도를 단호히 거부한다. 이 시도의 경위와 책임을 끝까지 규명할 것이며, 국가 존립에 실질적 위협이 존재했는지, 또한 계엄령 외의 모든 법적, 정치적 수단이 충분히 검토되었는지를 철저히 밝혀야 한다.

이번 사태를 단순한 실수나 오판으로 치부할 수 없다. 이는 민주주의를 무너뜨리고 국민의 기본권을 유린하려는 명백한 의도가 담겨 있으며, 우리는 이에 대해 철저히 책임을 물을 것이다. 최종 결정자는 누구였으며, 그에 대한 책임은 어떻게 지게 될 것인지 우리는 반드시 밝혀 낼 것을 요구한다. 계엄령 발동 시도는 국가의 민주주의와 법치주의에 대한 심각한 도전이었으며, 이러한 행위는 결코 용납받을 수 없다. 우리는 대통령과 그 주변의 관련자들에게 그 책임을 끝까지 추궁하고자 한다.

이번 사태는 대한민국의 민주주의와 법치주의가 얼마나 쉽게 위협받을 수 있는지를 실실히 드러냈다. 국민의 헌법적 주권자로서 이러한 불법적 시도가 다시는 반복되지 않도록 강력한 목소리를 낼 것이다. 철벽을 뚫고 권력의 남용을 허용하는 것과 같다. 우리는 이번 사태를 민주주의를 지키기 위한 분수령으로 간주하며, 법령과 국기의 기반을 침해하려는 모든 시도를 단호히 거부한다. 계엄령 발동 시도에 대해 우리는 끝까지 책임을 물을 것이며, 헌법적 원칙과 국민의 권리를 침해한 자들에 대해 엄중한 처벌을 요구한다.

원광대학교 학생사회는 이번 선언을 통해 우리의 입장을 분명히 밝힌다. 자유와 정의, 그리고 민주주의라는 숭고한 가치를 훼손하려는 모든 불의한 시도는 단호히 규탄받아야 한다. 국민의 권리를 침해하고 헌정 질서를 위협하는 어떠한 행위도 용납될 수 없으며, 이에 대한 우리의 분노는 깊다.

우리는 민주주의와 정의를 지키고 역사의 올바른 방향을 되찾기 위해 끝까지 책임 있는 자세로 나아갈 것이다. 이 땅의 민주주의를 수호하려는 우리의 결의는 흔들림 없이 계속될 것이다.

45년 만에 비상계엄이 선포되었다  
2024년 12월 3일 화요일 22시 30분, 하루를 마무리하려는 이르지 않은 시간, 대한민국 국민들의 일상은 믿기지 않는 소식으로 산산이 깨졌다. 더 이상 ‘대통령’이라는 명칭으로 부르는 것조차 아까운 국가반역자 윤석열은 국회의 야야음 가라여 이른바 “대한을 위협하는 반헌법적 행위”를 막고자 하고 있다 주장하며, 즉각 “반국가세력 척결”을 명목으로 비상계엄을 선포했다. 이어 23시경 계엄사령부를 설치하고 언론 및 출판에 대한 검열, 계엄에 저항하는 정치적 의사를 표현하는 모든 이들에 대한 즉시 체포를 명하는 포고령을 발포했다. 즉시 국회 봉쇄와 언론 통제를 지시하는 등 명백히 내란을 선포한 것이다.

과연 국민의 자유와 안전을 위협하고 있는 것은 누구인가?  
이제는 윤석열의 임기가 끝나야만 하는 지금, 그만 그만 도를 넘은 오만과 폭력, 불합리한 노동 구조 속에 말을 할 수 있었던 청년과 여성, 비정규직, 이주노동자와 장애인은 늘 자리가 없었다. 지금 이 순간에도 23조라는 숫자가 매겨진 계엄포고, 계엄시기에는 계엄법에 따라 25항이라는, 이승만 정권에 의해 만들어진 악법조항들이 우리의 숨을 조여오고 있다. 10대부터 20대, 30대까지의 여성 청년, 그 누구도 이제 더 이상 안전할 수 없다. 윤석열은 마지막 피마저 빨아먹으려 하듯 비상계엄의 선포라는 만행까지 이른 것이다.

민주주의는 거저 얻어낼 것이 아니다  
1970년 전태일 열사의 투쟁에서도, 1980년 5월 광주에서도, 1987년 6월 민주 항쟁과 노동자 대투쟁에서도, 2016년 광화문의 촛불시위에서도, 죽음과 폭력의 위협을 무릅쓰고 나선 사람들이 있었다. 역사적 진실의 모든 순간에는 노동자와 학생, 청년들이, 그리고 장애, 성별, 나이, 지역, 계층을 불문하고 인간답게 살 권리와 민주주의를 지키기 위해 수많은 국민들이 있었다. 지난 3일 비상계엄이 선포된 그 밤, 나아가며 극도의 두려움과 저항의 목소리 위에 있었던 동시대 직접 민주노동 사락의 숨결들은 노동조합과 지부와 시민 단체들, 맹목으로 군인만 아니라 시민들이 쌓아왔다. 국회 안팎의 발언한 시민들의 숫수나는 ‘도저히 집에 있을 수 없었다’라며, 광화문이었다.

계엄은 아직 끝나지 않았다  
4일 이튿날 계엄은 국회회의가 만장일치로 계엄 해제 결의안을 가결하고, 05시경 국무회의에서 계엄 해제를 의결하여 밤 벌의 계엄 해제 사태는 일단락되었다. 하지만 언제든 재도발될 수 있는 상황에 끝을 맺고자 하는 열망만 전국민에게 드러났다. 국회에서의 만장일치 해제 결의가 개겨져, 이제 더 이상 우리는 “계엄”이라는 이름으로 헌법을 위협하고 국민의 권리를 빼앗는 악의 법망을 넘기지 않겠다는 다짐으로, 그중 특히 노동자와 청년·여성·소수자·이주민 등 사회적 소수들로, 끝없이 맞설 줄 알아야 한다.

구호를 외치자! 역사에 판에 서는 것을 두려워하지 말자! 지난 3일 밤 3시간만에 국회에서의 계엄 해제안이 완료되긴 했지만, 계엄 주체들의 결코 끝을 지지 않은 독선들과 입막음은 계속된다. 윤석열은 계엄령 발령과 관련해 국가와 국민 앞에 책임을 져야 하며, 그간 과거 독재 정권 시절 위법들을 단죄해 민주화를 이뤄낸 해방의 선배들에겐  
전 부문 동지가 있다. 과거 독재 정권 시절 위법들을 단죄해 민주화를 이뤄낸 해방의 선배들에겐 전 부문 동지가 있다. 우리는 계엄령 해제 후에도, 오는 12월 7일 토요일 윤석열 퇴진 3차 총궐기 범국민대회에 참여하고, 이화여대 학생 시국선언에 이름을 실어 있을 필요가 있다. 어두운 밤이 지나고 새 날이 올 때까지 굳것이 흔들리지 말자. 투쟁!

반헌법적 계엄 선포로 대통령 자격을 잃은 윤석열은 즉각 퇴진하라!

12월 3일 밤, 무너지는 민주주의와 헌정 질서를 목도했습니다. 2024년 12월 3일 밤, 윤석열 대통령은 ‘자유민주주의 헌정 질서를 붕괴시키려는 반국가세력’에 맞서 결연한 구국의 의지로 비상계엄을 선포했습니다. 도심에 헬기 소리가 들리고, 국회는 봉쇄되었습니다. 중무장 군인들은 유리창을 깨고 국회로 진입했습니다. 이것이 역사책 내용이 아니라는 비참한 현실 앞에, 해방의 역사를 만들어온 이화의 마음에 사명감을 느낍니다.

헌정 질서를 붕괴하는 반국가세력은 누구입니까? 윤석열 대통령은 44년만의 비상계엄선포를 내린 피로 만든 헌정 질서와 민주주의의 약속을 훼손하였습니다. 국민과 언론의 목소리를 막고, 헌법을 위협한 자, 민주주의를 훼손한 자는 윤석열 대통령 본인이 바로 헌정 질서 파괴, 반국가세력입니다. 국민은 죽어가는 민주주의를 살리기 위해 분노를 느꼈습니다. 계엄선포 이후 대학생들을 포함한 시민들은 국회의 해산 결의안이 통과되기까지, 그 손으로 민주주의를 되찾고 국민이 만든 민주주의의 해방 역사를 지키기 위해 싸웠습니다. 하지만 아직 끝나지 않았습니다. 국민의 모든 권력은 국민이 만들어온 민주주의의 해방의 역사를 지키고자 한 윤석열 대통령은 국민의 손으로 심판 받아야 합니다.

이화가 만들어왔던 민주주의와 해방의 역사를 지키겠습니다. 이화는 지금까지 민주주의와 해방의 역사와 싸웠습니다. 1987년 6월, 학생들의 수업거부, 이화 교수 17명 시국 선언문 발표 등 준비발표 써오면서 역사는 지금의 민주주의를 만들어왔습니다. 그리고 2016년, 총학생회장과 총여학생회장 공석 상황과 그 너머 탄핵의 국면에서 이화인은 국민의 목소리를 만들어냈습니다. 또한, 그 과정에서 사립대학 최초의 총장 직선제를 만들어내며 대학사 민주주의의 기틀을 마련했습니다. 이화는 언제나 민주주의의 최전선에서 해방의 역사를 이어왔기에, 2024년 헌정 질서를 흔드는 윤석열 정권의 비상 계엄령 조치에 맞서 민주주의를 반드시 지켜내겠습니다.

이 조치는 민주주의의 근본 원칙인 시민의 자유와 권리를 심각하게 침해한 행위이다.

기습적인 윤석열의 비상계엄 선언은 정부가 국민과의 소통을 외면하고 독재적 통치를 강화하며 시민의 권리를 보호하고, 민주적 절차를 존중하여야 하는 정부의 제1의 의무를 저버린 재란스러운 행위이다.

우리는 곧 정부가 국민의 목소리를 억압하고, 이를 불법으로 간주하는 결코 용납할 수 없는 이 상황에 대해 깊은 실망과 분노를 느낀다.

4.19 혁명의 효시였던 4.4 시위의 조직였고, 5.18 민주화 혁명의 최초의 희생자인 이재종 열사의 불이 살아있는 전북대학교에서 총학생회는 학우님들의 정의와 인권을 수호하기 위해 온 힘을 다할 것이며 이는 민주주의를 지켜야 할 위법 및, 용납 못할 방식의 통치가 얼마나 비난받아 마땅한 행위인지에 대한 반증이 될 것이다.

우리의 목소리가 전북하지 않기를 바라며 전북대학교 총학생회는 윤석열의 비상계엄을 강력히 규탄한다.

이처럼, 44년 만에 발생한 초유의 사태에 우리 국민들은 공포와 혼란 속에 밤을 지새웠다.

대한민국 헌법 제77조 1항에 따르면 대통령은 전시·사변 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태에 있어서 병력으로써 군사상의 필요에 응하거나 공공의 안전질서를 유지할 필요가 있을 때에는 법률이 정하는 바에 의하여 계엄을 선포할 수 있다.

하지만, 이번 비상계엄 선포는 헌법의 어떤 요건에 해당하는지 도저히 이해할 수 없다.

정치적 이념의 갈등을 떠나 이번 비상계엄 선포는 어떠한 명분도 존재하지 않는 부당한 처사다. 국민들을 공포 속으로 몰아넣었고, 국민들이 지켜왔던 민주주의 가치를 훼손하였다.

윤석열 대통령의 이러한 비상식적이고 비민주적인 행위를 규탄한다.

2024년 12월 3일 22시 23분, 윤석열 대통령은 긴급한 명령을 시작하고 비상계엄을 선포했다. 이후 국회 출입 및 계엄군의 침입 등으로 발령됐으나 4일 1시 2분, 국회의원들은 당시 계엄 해제 요구 결의안을 의결하였다. 계엄사령부 육군 대령 박한수의 계엄사령부 포고령에도 불구, 시민들은 국회에 모여 연좌를 표명했다. 결의안이 의결되고 3시간가량이 지난 새벽 4시 27분, 윤 대통령은 계엄을 해제했다.

윤석열 대통령의 계엄선포는 저항과 탄압의 틈을 위협 위협이며, 국회로 국정을 보기 부단히 보는 북 국민에게 계속 중농의 반 제도로 송신하지만 것이다. 계엄령 선포와 같은 정부의 폭력행위는 여성과 소수자에게 불균형적으로 더 큰 영향을 미치며, 윤석열 대통령의 성차별적 정책이 단적으로 보여준다. 2022년 12월 31일 윤 대통령의 발언은 “자유민주주의의 가치를 지켜야 한다”는 명분이지만, 대통령의 성차별과 사회적 비평, 구조적 성차별이 포함된다. 이에 여성주의 교지 편집위원회는 12월 3일에 있었던 윤 대통령의 계엄 선포를 규탄한다.

윤 대통령은 비상계엄을 선포하며 정적들을 처벌하고, 강신창의 만행을 시행하며 계엄령의 시도 및 전투 명령을 했으며, 사법 마비 행위였다. 군대를 동원한 정부의 행위는 무차별적으로 여성과 소수자를 억압하고, 폭력을 강화하는 행위다. 시민들은 일부의 피와 고통으로 유지해 온 민주주의를 대통령에게 빼앗길 수 없으며, 국회는 윤석열 대통령의 성차별주의적 행태와 독재권력 강화 시도를 용납하지 않았다. 계엄군이 국회를 침입한 것, 포고령을 발령한 것 모두 명백한 위법행위다.

윤 대통령은 성차별적인 행보를 멈춰야 하며, 남녀가 세운 민주에 평화하고 질 높은 ‘자유민주주의의 가치’에 책임져야 한다. 윤 대통령은 계엄령을 선포하며 사회적 비평과 성차별적 혐오 발언으로 정치적 위기를 무마하려 했다. 윤 대통령의 권력 남용은, 내탄 이슈의 의도로 작동했다. 윤 대통령은 성차별 문제 해결이라는 의무를 내팽개쳤고, 구조적 성차별이라는 기존의 질서를 손대지 않았다. 사회에서 여성혐오는 강화되었다.

윤석열 대통령은 자유민주주의의 생명줄이자 가치에 반하는 이 모든 행위의 책임을 통감하고 퇴진하라.

그러나 퇴진은 끝이 아니다. 우리는 지난 3년 여 윤석열 정부가 저지른 여성혐의의 필요를 회피해왔다는 점도 지적한다. 이에 고려대 여성주의 교지 석순, 성균관대 여성주의 교지 경청, 이화여대 여성주의 교지 이화에불어, 중앙대 여성주의 교지 녹지가 연대한다. 이 성명은 성차별에 맞선 여성주의 교지의 연대이며, 여성혐오의 역사는 민주주의가 여성을 위해 위태로운가를 말해주며, 역사의 전환점에서 우리는 싸워야 한다. 성차별적 정치의 시대를 끝내는 우리의 연대는 권력, 독재, 그리고 여성혐오를 끝내려는 여성들의 분노이자 열망이다.  
역사의 전환점에서 여성혐오의 시대를 끝내는 우리의 싸움은, 끝내, 역사의 전환점에서 우리의 싸움은 살아계신 여성들을 위해, 미래의 여성들을 위해 이루어질 것이다.

페미니스트로서 역할에 헌신하며 시대를 가장 엄히하게 통찰하고 저항할 것을 우리는 이 글로서 천명한다.

대한민국 헌법 제1조에 따라 대한민국은 민주공화국이며, 대한민국의 주권은 국민에게 있고, 모든 권력은 국민으로부터 나온다. 그러나 대통령 윤석열은 전시도, 방만도 갖추지 않은 채 비상계엄을 선포하고, 헌법이 규정한 절차를 무시하며 시민들에게는 불편함과 공포로 지치지 않은 그 모면방만한 행태에, 전 국민이 분노를 토로하고 있다. 검수완수기거의 논이 서린 이곳에서, 가톨릭대학교 8천 학우는 다음의 죄를 묻어 윤석열에게 퇴진을 요구한다.

첫째, 헌법적 비상계엄을 통해 전 국민을 우롱하였다.  
둘째, 계엄군을 동원해 국회 무력화 및 국기탈취로 일의 극적적으로 반론을 주동하였다.  
셋째, 민주공화국의 대통령으로서 자격 박탈 수준의 위헌을 시행하였다.

윤석열은 들어라! 민주주의의 가치를 무용하는 그대로부터! 우리는 민주주의의 가치를 수호할 것을, 거부감으로 저항하는 그대로로부터! 우리는 권력에 기꺼이 저항할 것을, 정의를 참칭하는 그대로로부터! 우리는 불의에 항거할 것을, 결연한 의지로 결의한다.

헌법 제21조에서는 표현의 자유를 보장한다. 단순한 문장이 아닌 보장해야 할 기본적인 권리이다. 그러나 윤석열 대통령은 자신의 안위만을 위해 국민의 목소리를 빼앗았다.

절망(絶望)과 절망(切望) 사이에서 우리 건국은 자유대한민국의 민주를 지키는 데 끝까지 건국의 목소리를 낼 것이다.

        desc: `2024년 12월 3일 밤 10시경, 윤석열 정부는 “반국가세력을 척결하고 자유대한민국을 수호하겠다.”는 명분으로 대한민국 전국에 비상계엄을 선포했다.

이번 비상계엄은 헌법과 민주주의 원칙을 심각하게 위반한 중대한 조치로, 우리는 이를 강력히 규탄한다.

비상계엄은 국가의 안보 위기나 국민의 생명과 안전이 위협받는 극단적 상황에서 시행될 수 있는 조치이다. 그러나 윤석열 정부는 이러한 요건을 충족하지 않은 상황에서 군사와 위기의 명분을 악용해 선포하였고, 이는 명백히 헌법 위반이며, 민주주의 사회에서 국가 권력을 사유화한 폭력적인 시도라고 규정할 수밖에 없다.

비상계엄은 국민의 기본권을 제한할 수밖에 없는 수단으로, 그 선포와 시행은 헌법적 요건과 절차를 엄격히 따라야 한다. 시민적 자유를 심각하게 침해하며, 언론의 표현의 자유를 제한하고 정치적 결사를 금지하며, 사회 전반에 걸쳐 불신과 두려움을 조성할 수 있다. 따라서 윤석열 정부의 비상계엄 선포는 사회를 위협하고, 국민을 억압하는 행위로서, 국가의 권력을 남용한 중대한 위법 행위이며, 헌법적 질서와 국민 주권을 심각하게 훼손하는 사태라고 판단한다. 이러한 비상식적인 행동은 결코 정당화될 수 없으며, 반드시 책임을 물어야 한다.

이번 사태는 대한민국 청년들에게 어둠에 들이닥치게 하였다.  
군대는 국회의사당을 통제하고 언론은 검열되었다. 
국민들의 눈은 멀고, 귀는 닫혀버렸다.  
이는 결코 과거 패배 통렬 대한민국을 지킨 민주주의자들이 바라봤던 대한민국의 모습이 아님을 대한민국 모든 청년들은 알고 있다.

현재 우리는 다시 한번 대한민국의 민주주의를 수호하기 위해 결연한 목소리를 내야 할 상황에 직면했다.

윤석열 대통령의 계엄령 선포는 민주주의에 대한 선전포고이다. 경기대학교 총학생회는 결코 침묵하지 않으며, 끝까지 경기대학교 학생들과 함께 민주주의를 수호할 것이다.

        desc: `2024년 12월 3일. 44년 만의 비상계엄령이 선포되었다. 12월 3일의 대한민국은 절체절명의 전시 상황도, 사회질서가 무너진 사변에 처해있지도 않았다. 모두가 내일의 안녕을 위해 그 어떤 말과도 다름없이 휴식을 취하던 때였다.

윤석열 대통령이 말하는 “전시, 사변, 이에 준하는 국가비상사태”란 대체 무엇인가. 대통령은 대한민국 헌법 제77조 제1항과 계엄법 제2조 제2항을 위반하며, 모든 이들의 정치적·사회적 기본권을 앗아가려 했다. 임박부를 마비시키고 송고한 삼권분립의 원칙을 무너뜨리려고 했고, 엄연한 헌법 기관인 중앙선거관리위원회를 장악하려고 했다.

오늘의 우리는 일상을 살고 있지만, 내일의 안녕을 염려하지 않을 수 없다. 더 나은 인간, 더 나은 세계를 위해 우리 앞서왔다는 선배들이 정취했던 민주주의를 부르짖으며 단결한다. 학원의 민주화, 사상의 민주화, 생활의 민주화를 마음에 품으며 그 어떠한 억압으로 짓밟히더라도 다시 일어날 것이다. 100년을 향해 달려가는 자주경희의 이름으로 우리는 화합과 창조의 문화세계를 이룩하는데 힘쓸 것이다.

인간의 가치는 어디에서 오며, 무질서한 잠금의 세태 속에 우리는 어떻게 동료 시민이라는 정체성을 유지할 수 있으며, 작은 겸허에서 시작해 지금의 문명, 나아가 더 큰 미래를 우리는 어떻게 바라보아야 하는가. 요원한 세 가지의 질문을 가슴에 안고 우리는 외친다.

하나. 윤석열 대통령의 불법 비상계엄 선포를 강력히 규탄한다.  
하나. 그 어떠한 헌정적 계엄에도 우리는 굴복하지 않을 것이다.  
하나. 우리는 절망의 세상 가운데에도 인간다움을 잃지 않으며 선배들의 후마니타스 정신을 지켜나갈 것이다.

        desc: `지난 12월 3일 22시 30분경, 윤석열 대통령은 북한 공산 세력의 위협을 이유로 전국에 비상계엄을 선포하였다. 자유 대한민국 수호와 ‘우리 국민의 안전을 지키기 위함’이라 하였으나, 해당 조치는 절차적 정당성과 법적 요건을 철저히 무시한 반헌법적 폭거이다. 이어 계엄령에 의해 발표된 포고령 제1호는 집회와 시위 활동을 금지하고 언론 및 출판을 제한하는 등 국민의 기본권을 침해하였다. 이는 민주화 이래 첫 비상계엄 사태로, 대한민국이 그동안 쌓아온 민주주의와 헌법적 가치를 부정하는 행위이다.

이번 비상계엄 조치는 국민의 자유를 억압하고, 민주주의의 근본적인 원칙을 위협하는 행위이다. 자유민주주의 국가에서 정부의 권력 남용은 결코 용납될 수 없으며, 이와 같은 행동은 사회와 국민에게 많은 불안감을 조성했다. 자유민주주의 국가는 지도자들의 결정으로 무너지기 힘들며, 권력 남용이 동시에 불필요한 사회적 긴장을 초래하는 사치이다.

자유는 결코 주어지는 것이 아니라, 우리가 지켜내야 하는 것이라는 믿음을 갖고, 우리는 비상계엄 조치를 강력히 반대하며, 민주주의와 학생의 권리를 지키기 위해 끝까지 싸울 것이다.

        desc: `2024년 12월 3일, 대통령 윤석열이 긴급 대국민 담화를 통해 비상계엄령을 선포함으로써 ‘계엄의 밤’이 시작되었다. 이는 5·18민주화운동 이후 44년 만에 발생한 초유의 사태다. 계엄사령부 포고령의 서두에는 “자유 대한민국 내부에 암약하고 있는 체제전복을 도모하는 반국가세력”이 언급되었다.

대통령 윤석열은 헌정질서 교란을 방지하고, 국가 지속 가능성 보장, 미래세대를 위한 불가피한 조치라는 명분으로 비상계엄을 선포하였다. 하지만 6시간가량 이어진 ‘계엄의 밤’은 헌정질서를 파괴하고 국민의 권리를 제한하며, 국가안보와 자유민주주의 가치를 훼손하는 근본적 어둠으로 대한민국을 잠식하였다.

대한민국 국민이라면 마땅히 항거해야 할 기본권인 언론과 출판의 자유를 억압하였다. 심지어 국가공권력을 강제로 동원하여 국회를 장악하고, 계엄령 해제를 막고자 하였다.

반국가세혁을 척결하겠다는 정부가 국가의 근간인 헌법을 준수하고 있지 않으니 이 얼마나 황당무게한 일인가? 경악을 금치 않을 수가 없다.

무소불위의 권력 남용은 사회적 갈등을 증폭시키고 후유증을 남겼다. 그럼에도 불구 윤석열은 아무 사과도 하지 않았으며, 헌정질서 교란에 계엄령을 선포한 책임을 부정한다. 비상계엄령 선포와 철회된 단 6시간 동안 이루어진 일련의 과정은 국민에게 씻을 수 없는 상처를 남겼으며  
중대한 사회적 혼란을 야기하였다. 국가 수장의 책임 없는 단 한마디로 인해 우리의 평범한 일상이 한순간에 무너진 것이다. 2024년 ‘계엄의 밤’은 퇴행적 조치임이 명백하다.

1980년, 최후가 되리라 믿었던 계엄령이 해제되고, 시간은 흘러 2024년이 되었다. 태어난 이래 민주주의가 당연했던 세대가, ‘계엄’이라는 단어를 지겹도록 익숙히던 우리 가, 이제 실제적 폭력에 직면했다.

대한민국의 숭고한 자유민주주의 가치를 위해 산화한 4·19혁명의 노회한 열사, 그리고 거대한 불의에 혈혈히 항거했던 선배들과 함께 우리는 정의를 갈망한다. 우리가 바랐던 적지 않은 역사가 한 찰나라도 결코 죽은 것이 아니다. 정의는 민중동국의 이름과 발자취 아래, 동국의 숨결 속에 당당히 살아 숨 쉰다.

우리는 민주주의의 최전선에서 자유를 부르짖었던 동국의 정신을 이어받아 이 극악무도하고 반국가적인 비상계엄령 선포 행위를 강력히 규탄한다.

윤석열 대통령은 국민의 안전을 보장한다는 명목으로 비상계엄을 선포했으나, 절차에 입각하지 않은 비상계엄 선포와 비민주적인 포고령의 내용으로 볼 때 그 목적이 헌정 질서의 위배는 비민주적인 행태가 명백하다.

국회를 봉쇄하고 군사적 수단을 동원해 헌법을 무시하고 국민의 기본권을 침해하는 대통령에게 과연 대한민국의 주권자인 국민과 헌법을 지키려는 반국가적인 위협을 하는 세력은 누구인가.

올바른 선택을 하지 못하고 저지른 무책임한 행동의 결과는 대한민국의 미래를 책임지고 살아갈 청년들이 짊어져야 할 숙제이다.

국민으로부터 나오는 권력으로 국민을 능욕하려는 모습에 분노를 느끼고, 잘못된 방향으로 권력이 쓰이며 민주주의가 무너져가는 모습을 보며 하염없는 한탄을 또한 느낀다.

        desc: `-반헌법적 계엄 선포로 민주주의와 인권 위협한 윤석열은 즉각 퇴진하라-

지난 12월 3일 밤 우리는 ‘계엄’이라는 도무지 믿기 힘든 단어를 마주했다. 의회에서 야당 의원의 입을 틀어막는 것을 넘어선, 계엄령의 명령에 입을 막아야 할 것을 넘보아 본격적으로 ‘계엄의 밤’을 맞이해야 했다. 우리는 헌법을 파괴하는 정권의 폭거에 분노했다. 계엄의 폭력은 계속 보고 겪어온 것이다.

그러나 우리의 분노는 단지 독재와 폭력으로서의 계엄령의 폭력에서 비롯된 것이 아니다. 지도가 선포한 장면을 돌아가는 모습 역시 보았다. 계엄이 선포된 직후과 이유도 바로 ‘반도’, ‘승인’ 같은 이름의 이유들 때문이었다. 우리가 같은 이유의 폭력을 단지 개인과 집단에게서 외치지 새벽까지 입을 틀어막았다.

입을 틀어막았다. 윤석열 정권은 그 시위에서부터, 자유를 위협하고 생존을 위협하는 시민들의 목소리를 평평이나 무시하고, 입막음과 폭력으로 일관해 왔다. 이제 계엄 선포는 더 강한 폭력의 방식으로 목소리를 지우려는 것이다. 그럼에도 목소리는 멎지 않는다. 계엄령을 선포하려는 모든 움직임은 이제 더 이상 통하지 않는다.

“윤석열은 권리보장을 외면한 채 계엄령을 통해 다수의 생존을 담보하는 명분을 내세웠다. 그러나 이 생존에는 노동자의 다리 손실까지, 성소수자의 노동, 장애인의 생존이 담보되지 않았다. 우리는 윤석열 정권이 선포한 계엄령에 맞서 ‘노동존중’과 ‘성소수자 존중’, ‘장애인 권리’의 가치들을 내걸고 민주주의를 지켜야 한다고 본다. 특히 계엄의 폭력에 맞서 우리가 함께 서야 하는 이유는, 그 폭력이 다수의 권리와 생존을 위한 것이 아니라, 단지 정권의 권력을 유지하기 위해 소수자의 인권을 억압하는 폭력이기 때문이다. 윤석열은 즉각 퇴진해야 하며, 계엄 선포에 맞서 우리가 목소리를 낼 권리는 멈추지 않는다.” (박)

“윤석열은 권력 강화를 위해 민주주의와 헌법질서까지 부정하며 계엄령을 선포했다. 그렇다면 이 권력 강화의 폭력성이 노동자들의 목소리만을 목표로 삼고 있겠는가? 노동자뿐만 아니라, 권리를 주장하는 시민이 본래 국가의 주권자임을 부정하는 것이다. 성소수자, 장애인, 이주민, 학생, 여성, 시민들이 함께 내야 하는 목소리임을, 계엄령 선포에 맞서 우리는 기억해야 한다. 이제 계엄령에 맞선 연대의 목소리가 필요하다.” (김)

“계엄령의 폭력은 생존을 담보하는 폭력이 아니라, 정권의 폭력을 유지하기 위한 폭력이다. 따라서 우리는 노동자, 성소수자, 장애인, 이주민, 여성, 학생, 시민 모두가 함께 내야 할 목소리로써, 윤석열 정권의 폭력에 맞서야 한다. 계엄령은 정권의 폭력성을 더욱 강화하는 것이며, 이를 저지하지 않는다면 민주주의는 계속 후퇴할 수밖에 없다.” (이)

“우리는 목격한 사건은 44년만에 발생한 초유의 사태이며, 대통령이라는 무게는 지켜야 할 시민이 내린 결정이었다는 점에서 중대한 반헌법적 폭거였다. 무분별한 계엄령은 시민뿐만 아니라, 장애인의 생존을 위협하는 폭력이자 민주주의의 후퇴이기에, 윤석열은 즉각 퇴진해야 한다. 그리고 우리는 반드시 그 자리에서 일어나 목소리를 이어가야 하며, 장애인 권리와 인권을 위해 함께해야 한다. 윤석열은 퇴진하고 그에 부합하는 책임을 져야 하며, 그가 폭력의 기획에 앞장선 것에 대한 책임을 져야 한다. 이제 더는 계엄령 선포의 폭력성을 방치하지 말아야 한다.” (유)

“윤석열 정권은 지난 시기에 여성을 향한 폭력성을 강화해 왔고, 이제 계엄령을 통해 성소수자, 장애인을 포함한 시민의 권리를 통제하며, 이제 이 사회의 생존을 여성혐오로 이용하여 정권을 유지하려 한다. 입가 짧은 여성 대상 혐오 선전과 같은 맥락으로 계엄령을 선포하며 모든 두려움의 대상까지 계엄령을 피해자처럼 선전하였다. 선전에도, 이제 우리는 계엄령의 폭력을 저지하기 위해 여성의 목소리로 나서야 한다. 윤석열은 퇴진해야 하며, 여성의 인권, 나아가 모든 시민의 인권을 위해 퇴진해야 한다.” (민)

“우리는 시민사회로부터 계엄령이 맞서 연대해야 한다는 점에서 입을 모았다. 계엄령이 담보하는 권력만이 아닌, 그 권력에 맞서 연대하는 권력, 그 권력에 맞서 목소리 내는 권력, 그리고 그 권력에 맞서 함께 연대하는 힘으로 우리는 계엄령에 맞서고자 한다. 계엄령의 폭력성은 저절로 사라지지 않으며, 계엄령 선포에 맞서 우리가 끝까지 목소리 내야 한다.” (다)

“계엄령 정권을 끝내고 민주주의의 회복을 향해 나아가야 한다는 점에서, 계엄령은 결코 정권유지의 수단이 될 수 없다는 점에서, 우리는 계엄령을 반대하고 정권의 폭력성에 맞서 시민사회의 목소리로 함께 서야 한다. 이제 윤석열은 퇴진해야 하며, 계엄령 폭력성의 기획자이자 수혜자로서의 책임을 져야 한다.” (현)

우리는 학생들, 페미니즘 단체들, 비장애인과 장애인들, 이름을 부를 수 없는 이들과 함께 외친다.  
“반헌법적 계엄 선포로 민주주의와 인권 위협한 윤석열은 즉각 퇴진하라”

윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄은 실체적, 절차적 불법 비상계엄이다.

계엄군을 동원해 국회 진입과 비상계엄 해제요구 결의안 의결을 위한 집회를 통제하는 것은 대한민국 헌법을 위반하는, 일말의 절차적 정당성마저 무시하는 행위이며, 대통령 본인이 언급한 헌정질서 유지에 반하는 행위이다. 헌법에 의거하여 계엄 선포는 국무회의 심의 후, 국회에 지체 없이 통고해야 하지만, 이번 비상계엄은 이를 절차를 위반한 불법 계엄이다.

이어 발표된 계엄사령군의 포고령 제1호에 의해 우리 국민은 기본권을 철저하게 제한받았다.

계엄령은 국민의 기본권을 제한하며, 행정권과 사법권을 이양하는 국가 비상조치이기에 헌법상 최후의 수단으로 쓰여야 한다. 그럼에도 불구하고 이번 비상계엄의 선포 배경에 근거하는 것은 ‘전시’ 또는 ‘이에 준하는 국가비상사태’라고 보기 어렵고, 정치 상황 타개를 위한 권력남용, 비민주적 행보로 보인다.

이번 비상계엄으로 인해 추락한 국가의 위상과 대한민국 국민으로서 국가의 보호를 보장받을 수 없는, 위험적인 비상계엄에 대해 윤석열 대통령은 깊이 고찰하고 사죄하라.

윤석열 대통령은 이 글이 정치적 사안이 아닌 대통령의 비민주적 명령으로 만들어내었던 국가비상상황에 대한 미래세대의 목소리임을 명확히 인지하고 경청하라.

오늘날 우리 현실은 민주주의의 퇴보라는 임대 위기를 맞이하고 있다. 지난 12월 3일, 윤석열 대통령은 긴급 담화를 통해 “종북 세력을 척결하고 자유헌정질서를 유지하겠다”며 비상계엄을 선포하였다. 이는 절차적·내용적으로 위헌이자 위법한 행위이며, 지난 10년간 이뤄온 민주주의의 파괴이자 역행이다.

헌법 제77조 제1항 및 제4호, 계엄법 제2조 제1항에 따르면 국가의 안전보장 및 공공질서를 유지하기 위한 엄격한 기준 하에서만 계엄을 선포할 수 있으며, 계엄을 선포한 때에는 대통령은 지체 없이 국회에 통고하여야 한다. 45년 만의 계엄령은 절차적이고 실체적인 요건을 충족하지 못한 민주주의에 대한 심각한 도전이다. 3시간가량 비상계엄 하의 무장군인 국회 진입과, 군 헬기가 도심에 출동하는 등 21세기에 우리가 상상할 수 없는 장면들이 목격되었다. 대한민국은 오늘의 깊은 분열을 넘어 정치, 경제, 사회, 군 전반에 있어 심각하고 중대한 내상을 입었으며, 국제적 신임도가 저하되는 치명적인 위험을 피할 수 없었다.

국민의 안전을 위협하고 국가의 위상을 추락시키며 끝내 민주적 기저에 얽혔던 가치는 무엇인가? 숙명여자대학교 학생이 구국과 근대화를 위해 설립한 대한민국 최초의 민주 여성 사학이다. 우리 숙명은 국가적 위기에 대항하기 위해 끊임없이 그 저항의 불꽃을 피워왔다. 지난날의 숙명인들은 2016년, 전국 대학 중 최초로 동맹휴업을 선포하며 민주주의 재건에 앞장섰다.

오늘날 우리 숙명은 국가적 위기 상황을 타파하고 민주사회를 실현해 가는 藍明(남명)이다. 실천하는 것(儒)이다. 용납이 위협한 안락으로서 역사적인 소명을 부끄러워하지 않는다. 민주화의 역사 선두에서 전진(前進)을 펼치고 전진(前進)해왔다, 시대를 주도했던 숙명인들의 발자취를 따라 걷겠다. 청년이자 학생인 우리의 사명은 오늘날에도 대한민국의 미래를 위협해 더러지지 않았던 발걸음을 변함없이 이어 가겠다. 숙명에서 배운 민주시민으로서 사회적 책임을 실천하고, 오롯이 숙명의 대지를 바로 세울 것이다.

오늘 숙명이 피워내는 푸른 불꽃은 이 땅의 자유와 민주주의를 집어삼키려는 어둠을 밝힐 것이며, 그 불꽃은 용납을 넘어 대한민국을 수호하는 가장 뜨겁고도 자유의 활활 불이 될 것이다.

정치적 결사, 집회, 시위 등 일체의 정치활동을 금지하고 모든 언론과 출판을 계엄사가 통제한다는 내용을 주축으로 한 계엄사령부의 포고령은 대한민국의 자유민주주의를 짓밟았고, 국민의 권리를 짓밟았다. 이는 토대 약화와 진리를 탐구하고 학문의 진정이 되어야 할 대학교 본질을 훼손하고 탄압하는 것이었다.

비상계엄과 관련해 민주주의의 심장인 국회에 일체의 보고를 하지 않았으며, 초소의 임무를 받든 군인들은 국회의 무력 점거를 시도한 것은 명백히 부당한 처사이며 반민주주의 권력남용이다. 이러한 독단적인 불법행위에 참담한 심정을 표하며, 이는 사회 질서를 무력화하는 것으로 절대 용납할 수 없다.

대통령은 국민에 대하여 취임과 동시에 스스로 헌법을 준수하고 국가를 보위하겠다는 선서를 한다. 윤석열 대통령은 선서에도 불구하고 헌법을 위반하여 계엄 선포에 요구되는 절차적·실체적 정당성을 무시한 채 오로지 정치적 이익만을 위하여 계엄을 선포하였고, 계엄령 선포 사실을 국회에 통보하지 않았으며, 국회의 집회를 방해하는 포고령과 계엄군으로써 국회의 기능을 정지시켜 반헌법적 계엄선포에 대한 국회의 해제결의를 방해하고자 하였다. 결국 대통령은 국민에 대한 약속을 만연히 위반하였고, 직접 국가를 내란상태로 이끌었다.

과연 대통령이 언급한 현재 상황이 대한민국 헌법 제77조 제1항에 해당하는 국가비상사태였는가? ‘정부 권한 초월한 소수파 행위, 사변 및 폭동 발생’ 말일 수 없는, 반국가 세력 척결과 자유 헌정질서 수호를 목적으로 한 이번 비상계엄이 진정으로 위헌적 위기 상황인 것인지 묻는다.

대한민국 헌법 제77조 제4항, 계엄 선포 후 국회 통고 절차를 거치지 않은, 계엄령이 법적 효력이 있는가? 절차적 준거조차 거치지 않은 계엄선포는 헌법을 위반한 것이며, 헌법의 수호 의무를 지닌 대통령이야말로 법을 무단한 반국가 행위자가 아닐 수 없는 것이다.

대통령은 민주주의의 전당인 국회를 봉쇄하고 경찰, 군사력을 동원하여 언론과 집회의 자유를 통제하였다. 이러한 위헌 행위가 미래 세대를 위한 국가 수호라는 의효(義孝)로 칭송될 리가 절대 없음을 경고한다.

이는 대한민국의 민주주의 기틀을 붕괴시키고, 자유의 횃불을 꺼트리는 지극히 비상적이고 반민주적 처사이다.

대학사회를 구성하는 학생 대표자로서 포고문 발령으로 자유로운 학문의 탐구와 진리 추구의 요람을 무너뜨리고, 우리의 안전과 일상을 위협하는 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포를 강력히 규탄한다.

1960년 4월 19일, 중앙대학교는 ‘의(義) 죽고 차에 산다’ 정신을 의지해 자유를 향한 투쟁에 앞장섰다. 우리 중앙대학교는 자유민주주의를 잘못하게 짓밟는 자국의 통탄스런 현실에 분개해 외친다. “대한민국의 그 어떠한 개인도 헌법과 민주적 가치를 훼손해서는 안 된다.”

독재 정권 타도를 위해 흘린 선배 열정의 피와 의혈충이서는 구호 아래에 중앙대학교의 삶에 녹아들어 있다. 의와 참의 정신은 계승한 2024년의 중앙대학교는 국가와 사회적의 구원에 앞장서기 위해 윤석열 대통령의 헌법을 위반한 반민주적인 행위에 저항함을 결의한다.

대통령의 비상계엄령 선포는 그 요건과 절차 등 모든 면에서 헌법과 법률을 위반하였다.

그러나, 대통령의 비상계엄령 선포의 사유로 제시한 내용은 헌법과 법률이 규정한 계엄의 성립 요건을 전혀 충족하지 못한다.

On December 3, 2024, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law which was “a necessary call to protect the citizens’ safety, freedom and progress of South Korea, and to pass on a genuine country to the future generations.” However, it is ironic how that martial law restricts the fundamental rights of the citizens. Thus, we, the 58th General Student Council Central Operative Committee of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies (HUFS), strongly condemn President Yoon’s declaration of martial law.

All members of the Student Council have freedom of assembly, association and press.
Excerpt from HUFS Seoul Campus General Student Council Student Bylaws Chapter 1 Article 5 (Rights and Duties of Members)

HUFS students have been fighting against injustice and attempts at violating the university’s freedom and existence under the hope to constructively inherit the values of democracy. Yet, with President Yoon’s declaration of martial law, the first edict, which severely undermined the rights of HUFS students, was issued. For HUFS students who have been battling to protect democracy from the past, such treatment is unacceptable and unforgivable. We will never succumb to any undemocratic action and will actively protect our rights.

HUFS stands alongside the world.
Just as the slogan “Come to HUFS, Meet the World” implies, the world perceives South Korea through HUFS. Nevertheless, Yoon’s supranational martial law, which shocked nations across the globe, caused serious unrest and chaos to the HUFS students. Furthermore, despite HUFS being a nurture for educating global leaders, Korean and international students of HUFS had to stay up all night worrying about the democracy of South Korea. Yoon’s martial law flabbergasted the world and caused damage to a global university like HUFS. Tragedy like this should never be repeated. Thus, President Yoon must be held accountable for his actions.

Who's responsible for this nation's future.
Under the banner of Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, we will raise our voices to protect the rights of all HUFS members on the battlefront for freedom. The democracy of South Korea is no different from the democracy of HUFS. As a global university, HUFS will not let South Korea’s democracy be tampered with. Together with all those who stand for democratic values, we hereby demand a sincere apology from President Yoon and a thorough investigation regarding the declaration of martial law.

2024년 12월 3일 22시 23분, 윤석열 대통령은 대국민담화를 통해 반국가세력 척결을 위해 비상계엄을 선포한다고 밝혔다.

윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포는 방보과 절차적 정당성이 결여된, 헌법적 질서를 훼손하는 행위이며 헌법과 법치주의의 기본 원칙에 부합하지 않는 행위다. 이는 민주주의의 근간을 흔드는 중대한 사안이다.

이번 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포는 명분이 없다. 헌법 제77조에 따르면, 비상계엄은 전시·사변 혹은 이에 준하는 국가비상사태에 준하는 국가적 위기 상황에서만 재정적으로 허용된다.

그러나, 12월 3일 22시, 대한민국의 국토를 혼란스러운 상황이었다가 전시·사변 혹은 이에 준하는 비상사태였던가? 윤석열 대통령은 비상계엄의 본질을 무시한 채 오직 ‘반국가세력’ 척결의 명분 아래 국민의 권리를 제한할 목적으로 비상계엄을 감행한 것과 다름 없다.

이번 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄은 위헌적 비상계엄 선포다. 헌법 제1조, 제10조, 제21조 및 제77조에 따르면 대통령은 비상계엄 선포 시 지체 없이 국회에 보고하여 국회의 해제결의를 방해하거나 막을 수 없으며, 계엄하에 둔다고 하더라도 비상계엄은 국민의 권리, 즉, 계엄 상황이에도 일반 법에 의하여 보장된 기본적 권리의 본질적인 내용을 침해할 수 없다. 법령에는 일반법의 범위를 제한할 어떠한 법리도 근거가 없다.

그럼에도 프로그램은 국회 및 지방회의 일체의 정치활동을 금지하고 언론을 비롯해 국회의원을 제재로 시도했다. 프로그램은 반헌법에 기초한 계엄령하의 허명임이다. 이는 명백히 성부 법령에 대한 위반이며, 또한 윤석열 대통령은 헌법적 질서와 법치주의의 기본 원칙을 훼손했다.

[민주주의를 위협하는 권력의 오만을 용납할 수 없다.]
44년만의 비상계엄 사태는 대한민국 대통령이 행한 민주주의를 무시한 반민주주의적이고 반민주적인 행태이다. 국민의 자유와 민주주의, 법치주의의 가치를 훼손하는 것보다 더 이 나라에 우선이 될 수 있겠는가?

[우리는 묻는다.]
지속적인 위기와 혼란정 속에서도 국민의 기본권을 지켜져야 한다. 진정 이 나라의 상황이 비상계엄을 필요로 할 만큼 극단적 위기였는가? 이번 조치가 국민의 안전과 자유를 위한 선택이었는가, 아니면 권력을 강화하기 위한 판단이었는가?

[참빛은 끝내 어둠을 밝힐 것이다.]
이번 비상계엄 선포는 헌법적 가치를 훼손하며 대한민국의 민주주의의 근간을 뒤흔드는 중대한 사안으로 남을 것이다. 국민의 자유와 권리를 제한한 이번 행위에 대해 윤석열 대통령의 명확한 해명과 사과, 그리고 책임 있는 조치를 요구한다.

우리는 흔들리는 참빛이다. 참빛은 암흑을 뚫고 한자리에 함께 모여 저항을 초호한다. 더 나은 내일의 대한민국을 꿈꾸는 청년들의 목소리이다. 우리는 참빛의 참화에 참여하여 대한민국의 자유주의와 자유주의 수호를 위해 끝까지 나아갈 것이다. 우리는 억압에 굴복하지 않는 참빛의 신념으로, 민주주의와 법치주의를 반드시 지켜낼 것이다.

국민의 고귀한 목숨으로 수호된 민주주의는 어떠한 권력에 의해서도 감히 훼손될 수 없다.

윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선언은 결코 수용할 수 없으며, 이에 대해 강력히 규탄한다.

2024년 12월 3일, 윤석열 대통령은 "국가의 본질적 기능을 마비시키고 자유민주주의 헌정 질서를 붕괴시키려는 반국가 세력에 맞서 결연한 국군의 의지로 비상계엄을 선언했다"고 밝혔다.

여기서 언급된 국가의 기능을 마비시키고 자유민주주의 헌정 질서를 붕괴시키려는 반국가 세력이란 무엇인가? 5.18 광주 민주화운동과 독재에 맞서 싸운 민주 투쟁의 역사를 잊었는가?

불법 비상계엄의 선언은 자유대한민국의 헌정 질서를 심각하게 훼손하며, 헌법과 법률에 따라 실현된 정당한 국가 기반을 교란하고 대혼란을 획책하는 명백한 반국가 행위가 아닌가. 국가의 기능을 마비시키고 자유민주주의 헌정 질서를 붕괴시키려는 반국가 세력은 정녕 당신이 아닌가.

이에 국민은 경악과 충격을 넘어 심각한 분노를 표출한다. 윤석열 대통령은 민주주의의 투표권에 의해 대통령직에 오름에도 불구하고 한 치의 부끄러움이 없단 말인가? 당장 민주주의와 해방의 역사를 훼손한 책임을 통감하고, 국민 앞에서 진정으로 사과하며 정당한 심판을 받아야 마땅하다.

우리는 대한민국의 국민으로서 ‘민주주의’ 국가를 수호해야 한다. 끊임없이 목소리를 내고 행동해야 한다. 모든 불의와 억압과 불의에 맞서 싸우며, 연대의 힘을 결집해야 한다.

우리의 목소리는 절대 흩어지지 않을 것이며, 민주주의 역사의 후손으로서 책임을 다할 것이다. 더 이상 침묵할 수 없다. 우리는 함께 일어설 것이다.

대한민국에 다시는 국민의 아픔이 발생해서는 안 될 일이다.

더 이상 국민의 고귀한 목숨을 위협하지 말라.

이번 계엄령은 헌법적 근거와 정당성을 결여한 채, 오직 정치적 위기를 모면하려는 목적으로 자행되었습니다. 국가가 진정한 위기를 해결하기 위한 비상조치가 아니라 대통령이 자신의 권력을 내세우며 정치적 반대 세력을 억압하기 위해 국민을 생명의 대상으로 삼은 것입니다. 우리는 이번 사태가 단순한 정치적 실수가 단 한 번의 사과로 덮일 수 있는 일이 아님을 분명히 하고자 합니다. 대통령의 잘못된 결정은 반드시 책임져야 합니다.

국회가 계엄령 소식에 문턱사레졌지만, 그 과정에서 명백히 국민의 목소리를 짓밟하려는 시도는 민주주의에 대한 직접적 전면탄입니다. 국민의 대표 기관을 물리적으로 압박하고 일반법을 무력화하며 국정을 마비시키려는 반헌법적, 반민주적 행동은 결코 용납될 수 없습니다. 대통령은 계엄령 발동을 오로지 자신의 정치적 생존을 위한 수단으로 삼았으며, 우리는 이를 결코 용서하지 않을 것입니다.

예술은 자유와 해방의 이름입니다. 억압과 독재의 폭력 앞에서도 끝내 국민의 존엄과 자유를 지키는 예술의 힘을 믿습니다. 계원예술대학교 학생자치기구는 국민을 배신한 권력에 맞서 민주주의를 지키고자 합니다. 우리는 4.19 혁명, 5.18 민주화운동, 그리고 6월 항쟁의 정신을 이어받은 민주 시민으로서, 이번 사태를 침묵하지 않겠습니다. 국민의 자유를 위협하는 모든 시도를 단호히 저지할 것입니다.

윤석열 대통령은 이번 사태에 대한 책임을 져야만 합니다. 대통령은 국민의 신뢰 기반으로 삼아야 할 권한을 자기 개인의 정치적 도구로 삼았습니다. 우리는 계엄령 기획 및 실행에 연루된 모든 책임자를 끝까지 추적하여 법의 심판대에 세울 것입니다. 민주주의는 결코 포기할 수 없는 소중한 가치이며, 계엄령을 통해 헌정 질서를 파괴하려는 모든 시도는 좌시하지 않겠습니다.

우리는 다음과 같은 요구를 강력히 촉구합니다.

하나, 윤석열 대통령의 즉각 사퇴하라
대통령은 국민을 배신하고 민주주의를 위협한 행위에 대해 책임을 지고 즉시 자리에서 물러나야 합니다.

하나, 계엄령 발동 책임자 전원 처벌하라
계엄령을 기획하고 실행한 모든 관계자들을 명확히 밝혀내어, 법의 심판을 받게 하라.

하나, 민주주의 수호를 위한 재발 방지책 마련하라
비상조치 남용을 방지하기 위한 안전장치를 마련하고, 국민의 기본권과 헌정 질서를 철저히 보호하라.

대한민국의 국민에게는 4.19 혁명, 5.18 민주화운동, 그리고 6월 항쟁의 정신이 여전히 살아있습니다. 우리 계원예술대학교 학생자치기구 또한 행동하는 양심으로서 민주주의를 위해 끝까지 싸울 것입니다. 우리의 가치와 우리의 삶의 기반입니다. 윤석열 정부의 폭거는 반드시 국민의 심판을 받을 것이며, 우리는 민주주의를 위협하는 모든 시도에 맞서 싸울 것입니다. 우리의 목소리는 결코 꺾이지 않을 것이며, 예술은 진실과 자유의 편에 서 있을 것입니다.

윤석열 대통령이 주장하는 자유민주주의란 도대체 무엇인가? 대통령은 군사력을 남용하며 민의를 대표하는 국회를 봉쇄, 국민의 기본권을 억압하는 폭력적 자유 민주주의로서 헌정 질서의 붕괴를 도모하게 했다. 이것이 그가 말하는 자유민주주의의 실체인가? 나아가, 비상계엄을 불과 정치적 도구로 전락시켜 국민주권과 법치주의를 농단하는 것에 일말의 부끄러움도 느끼지 못하는가?

국민대학교 총학생회 비상대책위원회는 반복되어서는 안 될 아픈 역사를 재현하고, 국가적 트라우마로 안긴 윤석열 대통령을 강력히 규탄한다. 과거 국민들이 피와 땀으로 일궈온 자유 민주주의는 대한민국의 정통성이며, 그 존엄한 가치는 세계가 인정한 바 있다. 대한민국의 민주주의 정통에 위배되는 윤석열 대통령의 행위는 국민의 분노와 심판을 피할 수 없음을 명심하라.

국민대학교 총학생회직 전문은 우리 대학의 사명이 진리의 탐구와 자유의 수호에 있으며, 이를 단절시키는 일부의 세력에 단호히 저항해야 한다고 명시한다. 따라서 우리는 국민대학교 학생 사회를 구성하는 학생 대표자로서 일련의 사태에 대해 참담함을 느끼며, 일말의 오점 없이 자유 복악 학우들의 권리 수호에 앞장서겠다.

우리가 지키려는 민주주의는 단순히 체제만을 의미하는 것이 아니다. 우리의 뿌리인 해공 김익상, 성균 김성곤 선생의 정신을 계승한 국민으로서 진짜 자유를 목표로 민주주의 대한민국에서 살아갈 권리를 확보하기 위한 투쟁이다. 해방의 의지를 전승하는 국민대학교 총학생회 비상대책위원회는 윤석열 대통령의 비상식적인 폭거에도 자유민주주의의 가치를 확립하기 위해 끝까지 항거할 것이다.

2024년 12월 3일 화요일. 유구한 역사와 전통에 빛나는 우리 대한민국은 자유민주주의 기본질서가 훼손되는 낯을 붉히는 순간을 맞이했다.
3일 22시 25분 대한민국 대통령은 국가원수로서 ‘비상계엄’ 선포하였고 당일 23시 00분 계엄사령관은 포고령 제1호를 공표하였다.
비상계엄은 대통령의 권력 행사를 통해 국민의 자유를 일정치 제한할 수 있으며 제한 범위 또한 광범위하게 적용된다. 대통령은 이 행위를 권력발전적 긴급조치로 사유하였을지 모르나 이는 국가기본질서를 지키는 것을 넘어선다.
비상계엄은 헌법과 법률의 한계를 벗어난 국민의 자유를 제한하는 행위임에는 전제에서 그 어떠한 이유를 들어서도 납득이 불가하다.
이처럼 자유민주주의로서, 대한민국 국민으로서, 명지대학교 구성원으로서 우리는 현 상황에 대해 제51대 명지대학교 인문·자연캠퍼스 중앙운영위원회에서 깊은 유감을 표명하며 본 성명문을 발표한다.

명지대학교는 학문의 자유를 추구하는 대한민국의 중요한 학문기관으로서, 비상계엄을 선포한 사실과 특정 헌법기관의 기능을 통제하기 위해 계엄포고령을 공표한 사실에 대해 심각한 우려와 비판의 목소리를 바란다.
결코 용인될 수 없으며 오히려 그에 따른 철저한 책임을 요구할 것이다. 비상계엄은 헌법 제77조 1항에 따라 대통령이 국회의 승인을 얻어 선포할 수 있으나, 국회의 기본질서를 전제하는 것이라는 사실을 간과한 채 대통령의 독단적이고 독재적인 권력의 행사는 그야말로 폭거에 다름이 없다.
다시 말해, 헌법 수호의 의무는 대한민국 자유민주주의의 혼순이나 부정하는 방식의 행위에 무너질 수 없다.
현재까지 이어온 학자들의 고뇌와 노력에 명의 권력자를 허하오 무너지는 현실에 개탄하지 않을 수 없다.

대한민국 대통령은 헌법수호의 의무를 갖는다. 초헌법적 행위를 범한 대통령은 이에 대한 책임을 져야 한다. 초헌법적 행위에 관한 다음과 같다.

첫째, 대통령 의의의 헌법기관을 적으로 규정하고 이를 국가비상사태라고 하였다.
둘째, 직접적 정당성을 가지는 특별한 범법행위에 경찰력 · 군사력을 동원하였다.
셋째, 병력을 사용하지 아니하고는 극복이 불가능한 비상상황이라고 단정할 수 없다.

대통령 윤석열의 초헌법적 행위는 자유민주주의 헌정질서에 심각한 훼손을 끼쳤을 뿐만 아니라 대한민국의 역사를 역행하는 것임을 명백히 인지하자.
제51대 명지대학교 인문·자연캠퍼스 중앙운영위원회는 대통령 윤석열에게 말한다.
잠금 대한민국이 조퇴하기까지 굳건히 쌓아온 자유민주주의 헌정질서, 그리고 자유의 기지 속에서 발전한 학문적 가치를 격하시킨 것에 대한 온당하고 합당한 책임을 다시 한번 강력히 요구한다.

2024년 12월 3일 윤석열 대통령이 선포한 비상계엄은 국회와 지방의회, 정당의 활동과 정치적 결사, 집회, 시위 등의 일체의 정치를 금지하며, 자유민주주의 체계의 본질을 금지했다. 특히 포고령에 명시된 언론과 출판을 통제하며 진리를 좇는 학우들의 국민의 자유를 심각히 제한했다.

대한민국은 민주주의, 자유주의, 인권 보장을 기본 원칙으로 삼고 있다. 헌법 제76조는 대통령이 비상사태를 선언할 수 있는 조건과 절차를 규정하고 있다. 그러나 해당 조치는 결국 군사와 국민의 권리를 존중해야 하며, 헌법 제22조와 제23조에 의거하여 비상계엄 하에서는 기본권이 제한될 수 있지만 이러한 제한은 최소한으로 해야 하며, 법률에 근거해야 한다.

절차적 정당성이 결여되었고 헌법의 가치와 기본이 훼손된 비상계엄 선포는 사회적 불안을 조성한 행위로 간주할 수 있다.
우리 학우들은 ‘민주주자(民主主者) 서울과학기술대학교’의 이름을 걸고 밝히며

대통령은 한 나라의 대표자로서, 국민의 안전을 지키고 국가의 위상을 높여야 한다. 그러나 윤 대통령은 민주주의 국가인 대한민국에서 반민주적인 비상계엄을 선포하였고, 국민에게 불안을 야기하며 대한민국 대표자로서의 신뢰와 자격을 저버렸다. 여기서 우리는 묻고자 한다. 국민의 안전을 불모로 삼고, 국가 안위를 걱정케 하고 있는 반국가 세력은 누구인가? 대한민국 헌법이 보장하는 국민의 기본권을 유린하고 민주적 절차를 무시한 채 강행된 이 비상계엄을 결국 용납하는 행위이며, 이 어떠한 정치적 이유를 떠나 지난 수십 년간 지켜온 헌법과 자유민주주의의 근본적 가치를 훼손하는 행위이다.

우리는 대한민국 국민으로서, 국민과 국가를 해하는 불합리한 행위에 맞서 싸워야 한다. 지금도 담대히 남아있는 정의롭고도 숭고한 대한민국 국민의 민중성은, 국가의 희망을 직접 지켜내 왔으며, 그 희망으로 비로소 민주주의의 역사를 바라볼 수 있었다. 우리는 모두 45년 전 역사를 똑똑히 기억하며, 이와 같은 잘못된 행위가 결단 반복되지 않도록 연대하여 목소리를 내야 한다.

다시 한 번 촛불 들어 시린 겨울을 함께하리.
국회의원 190인의 선상으로 윤석열 대통령의 기습적인 비상계엄은 6시간 만에 막을 내렸다. 계엄군이 국회를 점령하고, 포고령을 통해 국민의 자유를 짓밟아도 자유민주주의를 향한 우리의 울음은 움직임은 멈추지 않는다. 두려움 속에서도 용기를 낸 한 아이나 촛불에 거대한 불씨가 되어 더 밝은 민주주의를 만들어낼 것이다.

우리는 국민 ‘인권과 평화’ 속에서 살고 있다는. 인권이 삶의 꽃이고 평화가 집행되는 이곳에서 우리는 무엇을 바꾸고 있을까. 주권이 국민에게 있음을 믿고, 국민 앞에 있는 이의 목을 둔 도시라고, 우리의 삶을 떠받치는 심장으로, 이 상황의 극구함에 울음이 고인다.

두려운 밤들의 울음은 분노가 되고 분노는 우리를 길러냈다. 2000명의 성공회대 학우들이여! 우리는 민주주의 없는 삶 속에서 희망을 찾을 수 없다. 저 하늘 밑에서 고개 숙였던 부끄러운 날들을 뒤돌아보고 국민의 앞날을 위해 견뎌줄 듯, 찾아올 봄빛에 불씨를 올리자. 부서진 겨울, 그 찬서리 끝보다 뜨거운 목소리로 맞서자. 내란내란이라는 것을 외치자. 내란내란이라는 것을 말하자. 내란내란이라는 것은 외쳐야 한다.
있는 건 겨눠지는 것이고 평화를 집행하는 것이지.
안고서 평화의 가치로, 민주주의의 가치를 집행하여 국민의 심판을 겨눠주자.
우리는 2000 학우여 우리 함께 외치자.

내란 수괴 윤석열을 탄핵하라!
윤석열의 내란 모의 작당들을 체포하라!

12월 7일, 오후 3시 국회 앞에서 20대 해방을 외치자.
성공회대학교 제40대 총학생회 비상대책위원회는 탄핵으로 해방을 이루는 그 날까지 앞서 외칠 것을 약속한다.`

헌법 제77조 제1항에 의거, 전시·사변 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태에 있어서 법률이 정하는 바에 의하여 계엄을 선포할 수 있다. 그러나 계엄 선포 당시 우리나라가 전시·사변에 준하는 비상사태였는가? 오히려 윤석열 대통령의 계엄 선포로 민주주의에 훼손되는 비상사태를 마주했다. 계엄령은 국가적 위기 대응이 아닌 권력 유지를 위한 폭압적 수단으로 이용한 윤석열 대통령의 행위는 역사의 심판을 피할 수 없을 것이다.

계엄을 선포했을 때는 지체 없이 국회에 통고해야 한다. 그러나 윤석열 대통령은 국회를 회피하였고, 대한민국 헌법의 위상을 무너뜨리는 정료로 작행했다. 민주주의를 수호해야 할 국가의 원수로서 권력을 남용한 윤석열 대통령은 도대체 무엇을 위해 그 자리에 서 있는가.

모든 국민은 약 150분간 언론·출판·집회·결사의 자유를 짓밟힌 민주주의의 처참한 현실을 눈앞에서 목도해야 했다. 국민의 자유와 권리를 지키고 증진시켜야 할 대통령이 오히려 공포와 불안을 조장하며 민주주의의 근간을 흔드는 이 파괴적이고 독재적인 행위는 절대 용납할 수 없는 폭거이다.

성신만의 자랑스러운 민주주의 역사를 이어온 세 가지 이념, ‘성신’, ‘지신’, ‘자등’을 바탕으로 선언한다. 우리는 정의와 진리를 추구하며, 어떠한 불의에도 굴하지 않고 민주주의의 가치를 지켜나갈 것이다. 자유로운 의사 표현과 교류를 억압하는 반헌법적 행위를 강력히 비판하며, 헌정 질서를 파괴한 책임자들에게 반드시 그에 상응하는 책임을 물을 것을 요구한다.

우리는 민주주의를 훼손시키는 행위를 좌시하지 않을 것이다. 독재와 억압에 맞서 항거한 역사의 정신을 계승하며, 자유와 정의를 위한 투쟁을 멈추지 않을 것이다. 자주성 주체성을 바탕으로, 민주주의를 지키고 국민의 권리를 수호하기 위해 단결할 것을 강력히 천명한다.

2024년 12월 3일. 윤석열 대통령은 비상계엄을 선포하며, 국회 장악을 시도하였다. 1981년 이래로 45년 만에 군을 수반한 자유 침탈의 시계가 돌아가기 시작하였다.

계엄사령부 프로그램 제1호 제1항과 제3항, 제4항을 통해 헌법 전문과 제37조 제1항에 명시된 국민의 기본권의 근간인 자유와 권리를 무시하였고 과거 군사독재 시절 그 어떠한 계엄 상황에서도 금지된 국회 해산을 민주주의의 성지인 국회를 제한한 프로그램 제1호 제1항은 명백한 위헌적, 독재적 발상이다.

계엄군을 투입하여 국회 해제에 대한 국민의 대항과 국회의원의 민주 행위를 억압했으며 이를 전국, 전세계로 송출하였다. 윤석열의 비상계엄 선포와 프로그램 1호는 국내 대륙 전체가 목도했고, 결과적으로 국민의 불안감 고조, 전세계적 보도권역, 경찰계제 불안감을 초래하였다.

비상계엄은 단순한 정치적 결정을 넘어 현 대한민국 상황에 절대적으로 용납되지 않는, 자유 민주주의를 분쇄하는 대한민국의 체제를 짓밟는 행위임을 알리며, 우리는 대한민국 국민으로서, 극심한 억압을 기하여 자유대한민국의 체제를 뒤흔든 윤석열 대통령을 강력하게 규탄한다.

그는 “북한 공산세력의 위협으로부터 자유대한민국을 수호하고 우리 국민의 자유와 행복을 수호하고 있는 피폐화된 중북 반국가 세력들을 일거에 척결하고 자유헌정질서를 지키기 위해 비상계엄을 선포했다”고 한다.

독단적으로, 법률적으로 이미 완전히 파산한 정권이다. 수십 년 전 독재정권의 상투적 수법을 그대로 답습한 그들의 결정에 더 이상의 민주주의는 없다. 헌정질서를 파괴하고 국민에게 총을 겨누는 정권에 더 이상의 정당성은 없다.

자유민주주의 기본 원칙에 따라 12월 3일부로, 자유대한민국의 가치를 훼손하고 국민의 자유와 행복을 억압하며 파렴치한 반국가 세력으로서 국가의 내란을 일으켜 자유헌정질서를 박살 낸 대통령 윤석열과 그 수하들에게
국민이 명령하노니, 즉각 퇴진하라!

제주는 부당한 공권력, 극악무도함의 정점인 4·3이 광풍으로 일어난 피로 얼룩진 투쟁의 역사를 간직하고 있다. 우리 선배 총학생회들은 국민주권에 부여한 민주주의의 가치를 지키고 국가폭력의 혈흔인 제주 4·3의 진상규명을 위해 맞서 싸워왔다. 그것이 우리가 이 자리에 선 이유이다.

우리는 항쟁의 역사를 계승하며 남다른 책임에 틀지 않는다. 우리는 4·3의 후예로, 우리인 선배들이 수없이 많은 억압과 탄압 속에서도 민주주의 수호를 위해 투쟁했던 뜻 있도록, 대한민국의 민주주의를 지켜내기 위해 맞서 싸울 것이다.
행동하는 최소한의 시대의 양심으로, 민주주의 최후의 보루로, 깨어있는 시민의 조직된 힘으로, 우리는 본연의 일에 나선 거리로 나와 외친다.

하나, 민주주의 가치를 훼손한 대통령 윤석열의 비상계엄 선포를 강력히 규탄한다.
하나, 우리는 어떠한 탄압 속에서도 민주주의를 지켜낼 것이다.
하나, 반헌법적 계엄선포, 윤석열 대통령은 즉각 퇴진하라.

대학인으로서의 자율성과 주체적인 역할을 통해 구현되어 왔다.

그러나 오늘날 우리는 민주주의를 근본부터 위협하는 상황에 직면했다. 지난 12월 3일, 윤석열 대통령은
‘우리 국민의 자유와 행복을 수호하고, 이는 파멸한 중북 반국가세력들을 일거에 척결하고 자유 헌정질서를
지키기 위해’라는 명목하에 비상계엄을 선포했다. 그때부터 계엄의 요건을 충족하지 못하였음에도 불구하고,
국가비상사태에 대배하여 부당한 경우에 부여한 대통령의 비상권한과 비상계엄의 발령권을 남용했다.

윤석열 대통령이 말하는 자유 헌정질서는 도대체 무엇이란 말인가?
무분별한 폭력과 억압, 군사력의 동원과 집회·결사의 자유와 표현의 자유의 억제. 이는 헌법이 보장하는 국민의 기본권을 침해하는 행위이며, 사회 정의와 자유를 실현할 주체로서 대학인, 더 나아가 그 자체로서 민주주의 정체성을
잃는 사안이다. 사회 정의와 자유 실현을 부정하는 것은 민주주의를 부정하는 일이다.

우리는 이러한 위기 상황에서 한림대의 이념과 정신을 계승하며 대학 본연의 기능을 다하고자 한다.
따라서, 권력의 부당한 사용으로부터 독립적인 자유를 수호하고, 사회적 책임을 다해 책무가 있다.
이에 우리는 비상계엄령 선포를 강력히 규탄하며, 다음과 같은 입장을 밝힌다.

윤석열 정권은 현 사태에 대해 책임을 다하라.
신뢰를 완전히 상실한 윤석열 정권은 이번 사태에 대한 책임을 끝까지 져야 하며,
민주주의와 사회 정의를 회복하기 위한 구체적이고 진정적인 조치를 즉시 이행해야 한다.
우리는 정권이 이에 응할 때까지 맞설 것이다.

민주적 가치와 헌지를 회복할 것을 촉구한다.
윤석열 대통령과 정부는 국민의 뜻에 귀를 기울이고, 본인이 짓밟은 민주주의와 법치주의의 가치를 회복하는 데
앞장서야 한다. 우리는 대학의 자유와 자율성을 지키기 위해 연대하며, 진리와 자유를 추구하는
한림대학교의 정신을 실현할 것이다.

한림대학교 총학생회 및 중앙운영위원회는 전 구성원의 일치된 힘과 뜻으로 민주주의를 수호하고,

지난 2년 반 동안 대한민국은 무정부 상태로 국정이 운영되는 것과 다름없었다. 이태원 참사로 많은 시민이 목숨을 잃은 현장에서조차, 이대로는 살 수 없다며 자신의 몸을 철창에 가두고 싸웠던 조선소 노동자들의 싸움에서도, 물이 차오른다던 지하차도에서도, 우리 는 대통령을 찾을 수 없었다. 경제적 압박과 가속으로 자영업자와 노동자 모두 힘든 삶을 살아가는 현장에서도, 헌법에 기본하는 언론의 자유와 표현의 자유가 위축되고, 약자와 소수자에 대한 차별과 혐오가 극에 치닫는 작금의 현실에서도 대통령이 존재는 보이지 않는다. 수많은 노동자가 목숨 건 투쟁을 하고 있음에도 그는 그가에서도, 여성노동자가 매일매일 싸우고 있는 고용승계에서조차 우리는 여전히 대통령을 부재중이다. 사회적 재난과 약자와 소수자에 대한 차별과 혐오가 멈춰지고 있지 않은 지금 우리는 윤석열 대통령은 무엇을 하고 있었는지 묻지 않을 수 없다.

한반도에서 전쟁 위기가 고조되고 있는 지금도 윤 대통령은 반헌법적 파병을 진행하며 주변국들을 자극하고 있다. 경제위기로 자영업자와 노동자들의 삶이 피폐해지고 있지만, 금융투자소득세 폐지 및 부자 감세 등으로 민생을 벼랑 끝으로 내몰고 있다. 시선을 돌리면 의료 현장에서는 의료대란의 여파로 여전히 국민의 건강과 생명이 위협받고 있으며, 뉴라이트 인사 임명 및 한·일 굴욕 외교로 국민들은 부끄러움과 모욕감을 느끼고 있다. 이 와중에도 윤 대통령은 자신의 무지함을 인정하지 않고 있으며, 이념을 잣대로 국민을 양분하는 사태는 계속되고 있다.

지난 12월 3일 밤에는 기어이 '비상계엄'을 선포하였다. "북한 공산 세력의 위협으로부터 자유대한민국을 수호하고 우리 국민의 자유와 행복을 억압하고 있는 파렴치한 종북 반국가 세력들을 일거에 척결하고 자유 헌정질서를 지키기 위해 비상계엄을 선포했다"고 한다. 하지만 우리는 지금 우리가 어느 시대를 살아가고 있는지 아연실색 하였다. 색깔론과 적대적 대극 시간만으로 일관해 온 윤석열 정부는 이 사건에도 난 탓을 하며 무능과 무지를 드러내고 있다. 그리고 주권자인 국민들에게 총구를 들이대고 국회에 무장군인들이 진입하는 등 돌이킬 수 없는 만행을 저질렀다. 국회와 시민들의 노력으로 간밤의 소요가 일단락되었지만, 윤석열 정부를 끌어내리고 우리가 지난 밤에 목도한 현 정부의 반헌법적인 행태를 명명백백 바로잡아야 하는 수습의 과정은 여전히 남아 있다.

이제는 행동해야 할 때이다.

국회의 결정에 24차례나 거부권을 행사할 동안, 정부가 재정 건전성을 앞세워 부자 감세라만 언급하는 사이 물가는 나르고 1,900조가 넘는 가계 부채로 시름한 동안, 노동자의 최소한의 권리를 지키기 위한 노조법 개정안이 가로막혀 있었던 시간 모두 우리는 참지 말았어야 했다. 이제는 단호하게 이야기할 시간이 왔다. 윤석열 대통령과 정부 관료들, 특히 이번 '비상계엄'을 주도한 세력들을 끌어내리고 수사하고, 처벌해야 한다.

우리는 더 이상 참담한 현실을 묵과하지 않을 것이다.

민주주의를 위한 싸움에 가장 앞장섰던 한신대학교의 투쟁의 전통, 불의에 굴하지 않았던 열사들의 정신을 이어받아, 퇴행의 시대를 만들어가는 윤석열 정부를 심판할 것이다. 한신의 재학생, 졸업생, 한신에 몸담은 모두의 이름으로 윤석열 정부의 퇴진을 다시 한 번 엄중히 촉구한다.

우리 헌법은 전쟁과 같은 전시나 사변 상태에서만 계엄 선포를 허용한다. 그러나, 2024년 12월의 대한민국은 평화의 일상을 누리던 때에 있었다. 민주주의를 바로잡겠다는 윤석열 정부는 헌법적 절차를 무시하고 독단적으로 내몰아서 계엄령을 도대체 누구를 위한, 무엇을 위한 조치인가?

그날 밤 비상계엄령이 선포된 이후 미술대학 학생들은 야간 작업 중 가족의 안부를 확인하며 공포 속에서 하루를 지새웠다. 우리는 군을 앞세운 권력이 우리의 머리 위를 지나 민주주의의 상징인 국회로 향하는 것을 두 눈으로 똑똑히 보았다.

우리는 이를 좌시하고 침묵하지 않을 것이다. 국민을 배제한 채, 오히려 국민 위에 군림하려는 윤석열 정부만큼 민주주의의 가장 큰 적은 없다. 6일 오늘, 우리는 계회해서 체계적인 대응을 통해 윤석열 정부에 맞서 싸우려 하고 있다. 국민이 부여한 권력으로 국민을 지키지도 못할 뿐만, 민주주의의 가치를 훼손하는 윤석열 정권을 반드시 강력 규탄하고 조치를 강력히 규탄한다.

윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포는 헌법 제77조의 계엄법 제2조, 제13조에 명시된 헌법을 명백히 위반한 행위이다. 헌법상 대통령의 계엄선포에 대한 권력남용을 막기 위해 “대통령은 계엄 선포 후 지체 없이 국회에 통고하여야 하며, 국회가 재적의원 과반수의 찬성으로 계엄 해제를 요구하면 대통령은 이를 해제하여야 한다.”고 명시되어 있다. 하지만, 대통령은 국회에 통고하지도 않았고, 국회가 재적의원 과반수의 찬성으로 계엄 해제를 요구하지도 않았으며, 이러한 헌법을 훼손한 비상계엄 선포였음을 선포했다.

2024년 12월 3일 23시 00분, 계엄사령부는 포고문을 발표했다. 계엄사령부의 포고문 제1항에는 “국회의 지방의회, 정당의 활동과 정치적 결사, 집회, 시위 등 외세의 정치를 금지한다.”는 내용이 담겼으며 계엄사령부는 계엄을 위 앞세워 국회를 장악하려는 의도를 드러냈다. 이는 대한민국의 삼권분립 아이디어를 허물며 근본을 훼손한 위법적 조치이자 헌법상에서 명시된 계엄을 견제할 수 있는 최후의 수단인 국회마저 압박한 권력몰입의 조치였다.

우리는 가천대학교 학칙 제1조 제1항에 명시된 가천대학교 교육이념인 “박애, 봉사, 애국”의 정신을 함양한 지성인으로서 과거부터 현재까지 민주주의 수호를 위해 투쟁해온 수많은 학생들과 민주주의의 숭고한 정신과 이념에 대한 훼손을 좌시하지 않을 것이다.

대한민국 자유민주주의 가치와 정의, 헌정질서를 훼변한 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포를 그대로 용납할 수 없다.

우리는 민주주의의 법치주의적 정당성, 헌법 정신이 비탈린 윤석열 대통령의 무분별한 행위에 대해 강력히 규탄하며 대한민국 국민과 민주주의 수호를 위해 투쟁한 학생, 시민, 노동자와 연대할 것이다. 민주주의의 숭고한 이념과 가치를 훼손한 대통령은 더 이상 대통령의 자리에 설 자격이 없다. 국민과 민주주의의 자유, 평화가 지켜지길 염원하며 대한민국의 지성과 학생들은 대통령의 퇴진을 촉구한다.

현재 대한민국의 현실은 ‘전시·사변 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태 상황’에 놓여 있지도 않으며, ‘병력으로써 군사상의 필요에 응하거나 공공의 안녕질서를 유지할 필요가 있다’고 볼 수 없다. 윤 대통령의 비상계엄 선포는 가장 기본적인 계엄법 절차마저 이루어지지 않은 위법 행위이고, 비상계엄과 동시에 선포된 포고령은 헌정질서 파괴임이 너무나 자명하다. 대통령이 이처럼 아무런 권력만으로 국민의 의사와 의결, 국회의 권능에 제기하려 했던 이 사태는 국가비상사태에 준하는 행위일 것이다. 비상계엄 선포 이후 계엄군이 국회의사당을 장악하고 국회 의사당이 열리지 못하도록 봉쇄하는 장면, 약 8개 수많은 피로 쓰인 민주화 운동의 장면을 연상시키는 군홧발의 소리였다. 그리고 수많은 이가 너무나도 상세히 잘 해대는 장관을 우리는 그간 들어왔다. 그광기에게 더 이상 좌시할 수 없다.

계엄사령부가 포고한 1호 포고령에는 “모든 언론물, 출판물, 집회, 결사의 통제를 받는다”는 내용이 담겼다. 언론을 향한 검열과 통제가 시작된 순간 대한민국의 민주주의는 한 번 더 크게 흔들렸다. 그러나 진실은 쉽게 은폐할 수 없다. 언론은 국가가 국민으로부터 위탁받은 정권 권력을 감시할 권리를 갖고 있으며, 그 의무와 권한은 국민의 기본권에 기초하기 때문이다. 비상계엄 하에서의 계엄이 아무리 언론으로 진실을 규명해 내더라도, 불의에 맞서야 한다는 본연의 존재 이유에 다름 아니다. 건국대학교 대학언론도 그저 묵인하지 않는다. 우리는 2024년 밤에서 12·3 비상계엄 선포 사태의 진실을 기록하고, 정의를 향한 목소리를 내는 대학언론으로서 소임을 담아 성명문을 발표한다.

건국대학교는 1986년 10월 28일 ‘반외세 자주화, 반독재 민주화, 조국통일’ 3대 구호를 내걸고 학생 민주화운동을 전개했다. 10·28 건대항쟁의 정신을 기억하는 건국대학교 대학 언론으로서, 또한 誠(성)·信(신)·義(의) 이념의 건국대학교 학생으로서, 민주주의를 훼손하는 어떠한 행위에도 용납할 수 없기에 우리는 부당한 권력에 저항한다.

하나. 계엄이라는 이름의 총칼을 국민에게 겨눈 윤석열 대통령을 규탄한다.
하나. 비상계엄 선포를 계획하고 실행한 모두는 대한민국과 민주주의를 도탄에 빠뜨린 자금의 상황에 대한 책임을 져야 한다.
하나. 언론은 어떠한 형태로든 억압과 통제하지 말라.

        desc: `On December 3, 2024, at 10:30 PM, President Yoon Suk-yeol abruptly declared martial law. While the National Assembly passed a resolution to revoke the state of martial law approximately three hours later, at 1:00 AM on December 4, the President remains silent amidst mounting calls for impeachment.

South Korea is not currently facing a “state of war, armed conflict, or a national emergency equivalent thereto,” nor does public safety or order necessitate military intervention. President Yoon Suk-yeol’s abrupt declaration of martial law on December 3, 2024, blatantly violates the Martial Law Act, disregarding even the most fundamental procedural requirements. The ordinances issued under martial law constitute a direct assault on the constitutional order. Far from addressing any genuine crisis, these actions appear to serve the President’s personal interests, creating a self-imposed emergency that undermines democracy itself.

The images of martial law forces seizing control of the National Assembly, obstructing its proceedings, and suppressing legislative functions serve as chilling reminders of how quickly the foundations of democracy can be destabilized. The proclamation that “all media and publications shall be subject to the control of the Martial Law Command” launched an attack on press freedom, shaking democracy to its core. Yet, truth cannot be silenced. The press exists to check and criticize the abuse of power, and in the wake of martial law’s revocation, countless media outlets have reaffirmed their indispensable role in exposing injustice.

As the University Press of Konkuk University, we will not remain mere bystanders. We are committed to recording the truth of the December 3 Martial Law Crisis, exposing abuses of power, and upholding justice. Inspired by Konkuk University’s proud legacy, including the 1986 pro-democracy movement, and guided by the principles of SungShinUi (誠信義)—Sincerity, Fidelity, and Righteousness—we rise in resistance against this unjust exercise of power to safeguard the freedoms and sovereignty entrusted to us.

First, We condemn President Yoon Suk-yeol for turning the instruments of martial law against the nation.
First, We demand accountability from all those who planned and executed this grave violation of South Korea’s democracy.
First, We call for the protection of the nation’s safety, sovereignty, and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press, assembly, and association.

민주주의 훼손을 목도한 예비 교사들은 침묵하지 않을 것이다.
2024년 12월 3일 밤 22시 27분, 윤석열 대통령은 ‘국민의 자유·행복을 위한다’는 반국가세력을 척결하고 자유 헌정질서를 지키기 위해 비상계엄을 선포했다. 계엄사령부는 모든 언론과 출판을 통제하고, 정치적 결사·집회·시위 등 일체의 정치활동을 금하는 포고령(제1호)을 발령했다. 무장한 계엄군은 서울 시청과 행정부를 넘어 내국 국회의사당 내부에 총부를 들며 국회의원 창을 깨고 진입했다. 1979년 이후, 45년 만에 처음으로 국민의 일상을 멈추로 한 기술적이고 독단적인 비상계엄이 내려진 것이다. 윤석열 대통령의 위험천만한 계엄으로 우리 시민들의 피로 물들어 민주주의 역사가 오염되었다.

계엄군의 총구는 우리 국민에게 겨누며 비민간적 체제의 폭정을 정당화한다. 부당한 국가 권력에 맞서 싸운 우리의 민주주의는 ‘교사’라는 이름으로 시작될 수 없는 기간적 사명감을 짊어진다.
예비 교사들은 아이들에게 부끄러운 역사를 남기지 않겠다. 국민의 기본권을 지킬 수밖에 없는 국가는 비상계엄을 낼 수 없고, 반민주적, 반민간적 비난과 사회의 엄중한 심판을 모면할 수 없다. 국민의 자유와 권리가 집회의 뿌리에서 자라날 때, 교육자는 그 현실 속에 있다. 이러한 역량은 우리의 마음을 통해, 아이들의 몸을 빌려 끊임없이 되새겨야 한다.

우리 예비 교사들은 교육자의 소명을 다해 대한민국의 민주주의를 지켜 아이들 앞에 부끄럽지 않게 설 것이다.

반민주적, 반국가적 행위를 저지른 윤석열 대통령은 국민 앞에서, 역사 앞에서 심판받아야만 한다. 민주주의의 근간을 흔들고 국민의 안전을 위협하면서도 어떤 심판조차 받지 않은 역사가 없다. 민주주의로서 시민들이 그를 심판할 약서로 기록되어야 한다. 촛불 교사가 되어 교단에 나서야 한다. 우리는 비노 서서 부끄럽지 않은 미래를 만들고, 민주주의를 가르칠 수 있어야 한다. 이러한 역량은 우리의 마음을 통해, 아이들의 몸을 빌어 끊임없이 되새겨야 한다.

전국의 교육대학생들은 “우리가 가르칠 역사는 우리가 만들겠다”는 소명 아래 2016년 당시 동맹휴학 시국선언으로 예비 교사 투쟁을 이어왔다. 국민대학교의 주권은 국민에게 있고, 모든 권력은 국민으로부터 나온다는 헌법의 기본권 수호에 앞장서며 민주주의를 지켜왔다.
윤석열 대통령의 위헌적 행태와 헌법적 질서를 부정하는 일이 다시는 반복되지 않도록 국민의 권리와 자유, 민주주의의 가치를 수호하고 앞장서서 민주주의를 지키겠다.

하나. 윤석열 대통령의 위헌적 비상계엄령을 규탄한다.
하나. 우리 예비 교사들은 교육자의 소명을 다해 반민주적, 반국가적 행위에 대한 책임을 묻겠다.

이후 17시 김건희 특별법과 윤석열 탄핵소추안에 표결이 부쳐졌다. 재적의원 300명 전원 참석으로 시작된 본회의의 첫 결의는 특검법을 통과한 찬성 198 반대 102표로 부결되었다. 그러나 탄핵소추안은 달랐다. 윤석열 탄핵소추안을 앞두고 국민의힘 의원들은 국회를 떠나기 때문이다. 탄핵소추안은 가결의 성립 정족수가 재적의원 절반인 2 이상 찬성일 것이다. 국민의힘의 의석수가 가결 요건을 충족하지 못하게 따라 자동으로 안건이 부결되도록 한 것이다. 전국 곳곳에서 거리를 메운 시민들은 표결에 불참한 국민의힘 의원들의 직무 유기를 외치며 참석권을 촉구했고, 결국 우리의 집요함은 21시 26분 투표 불성립을 선포했다.

오늘의 하루는 허탈했다. 대국민 담화는 국민 앞에서는 추악한 변명이 지나지 않았고, 국회마저 무너져 버렸다. 촛불은 꺼지지 않았다. 우리는 다시 이 자리에서 불을 붙일 것이다. 내일도, 동생이 싸워야 한다. 계엄의 가능성이 있고 계엄의 집행이 진행 중이라는 점을, 자신의 직권사항이라는 이유로 계엄을 거는 국가원수의 존재는 잊을 수 없다. 이제는 가능하고, 내란만 벌어 버치면 국가원수의 자리에 있는 자는 계엄을 걸 수 있다.

대한민국집증은 부결된 탄핵소추안을 오는 11일 임시국회를 통해 재발의할 것이라 밝혔다. 우리는 아직 거리에 있다.
헌정을 위협하는 폭력과 민주주의를 위협하는 세력에 맞서 끝까지 자리를 지킬 것이다.

2024년 12월 3일 밤 10시경, 윤석열 대통령은 계엄령을 선포하며 ‘자유대한민국의 영속성을 위해 부득이한 것’이라고 발표하였다. 또한, ‘국가가 자유민주주의의 체제를 붕괴시키는 괴물’이 되지 않게 대한민국의 자유민주주의를 지키기 위해 계엄령을 선포하였다. 하지만 3일 자정, 계엄령에 의해 국회 출입을 제한하고, 프로그램의 예에 모든 정치활동과 언론, 출판을 통제한 것은 윤석열 대통령이다. 민주주의의 체제를 붕괴시키는 괴물의 본인임을 알고 있는지 묻고 싶다.

민주동덕의 민주는 8000 동덕인으로부터 왔다. 민주주의를 위해 싸워온 동덕여대 총학생회 및 중앙운영위원회는 국가의 민주주의가 위협받는 상황에 거대한 분노를 느끼며 민주주의를 수호하고자 윤석열 대통령의 비상 계엄령 선포에 강력히 규탄한다.

윤석열 대통령의 행동은 민주주의와 법치주의를 훼손하는 행동이다. 온 국민을 벼랑 끝에 내몬다. 대한민국 헌법 제1조 1항은 ‘대한민국은 민주공화국이다’, 2항은 ‘대한민국의 주권은 국민에게 있고, 모든 권력은 국민으로부터 나온다’로 규정되어 있다. 이러한 국민의 헌법적 권리가 나라의 수호자로 인해 침해당하고 위협당했다. 대통령의 단 한 순간에, 한 번의 발언으로 온 국민이 절망하고 분노하였다. 대통령으로서, 국민을 수호하기 위한 존재로서의 모든 역할이 부끄럽지 않은가. 우리는 너무 부끄럽다. 국민을 위협하고 두려움을 던지는 대통령을 용납할 수 없다. 민주주의의 안녕을 바라는 지성인으로서 반민주주의와 반법치주의를 행하는 윤석열 대통령을 규탄한다.

단 6시간 만에 비상계엄령은 국회의원 190명 참석, 190명 찬성으로 해제되었다. 해제되기까지 밤중에도 분노하며 국회로 달려간 8개월 내 시민들이 있었고, 해제에 이어질 잘못된 판단을 막기 위해, 우리를 지키기 위해 국회로 나간 많은 대학생이 있다. 민주동덕의 대학생으로서 윤석열 대통령의 잘못을 잊지 않을 것이며 끝까지 관련된 책임을 촉구할 것이다.

대한민국 헌법상 계엄령은 전시·사변 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태에만 엄격한 기준 하에서 선포가 가능하다. 그러나 윤석열 정부가 선포한 계엄령은 그 어떤 요건에도 해당하지 않으며, 절차적 정당성도 결여된 명백한 위법행위였다. 국회에 해제되기까지 6시간 동안 국민들은 공포에 떨며 참혹한 밤을 보내야 했다. 그 위에는 불안하는 사회질서로 국민을 향한 최소한의 책임 의식조차 보이지 않았다. 이는 국가 원수로서 국민의 신뢰를 저버릴 것이며, 그 자격 또한 스스로 포기한 것임이 틀림없다.

민주주의는 한 사람의 독단적 의지에 의해 좌우될 수 없다. 이는 이 땅의 모든 국민이 함께 지키고 만들어 가야 할 귀중한 가치이자, 대한민국의 미래를 위한 불가침의 영역이다. 우리는 국민의 권리와 자유를 침해·억압하려는 어떠한 시도도 단호히 거부한다.

한 나라의 대표자가 국민의 목숨을 위협하고 권리를 침해하려는 행태를 어떻게 묵과할 수 있겠는가? 윤석열 정부의 독단적이고 반민주적인 행태는 그간 선조들이 쌓아온 민주주의의 역사를 무너뜨리고, 그 근간을 통째로 흔드는 폭정적 행위와 다름없다. 우리는 참담한 현실을 더 이상 묵과할 수 없다. 지난 2년 동안 그의 독선이 초래한 국가의 혼란과 피폐는 국민의 삶을 바로잡기 위해 행동할 것이다.

대통령 윤석열은, 특정 국외세력을 향해
‘자유 대한민국의 행복을 막아버린 파렴치한 종북 반국가세력’, ‘백악관 앞 일삼은 망국의 원흉’ 등이라고 표현하며 ‘비상계엄령’을 통해 들어준 국민들을 압박하였다.

비상계엄령은 전시, 사변, 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태가 발생했을 때 대통령이 선포할 수 있다.
하지만 지금이 왜와 같은 상황인가?

비상계엄령은 국민의 기본권을 심각하게 훼손할 수 있으며
이는 계엄사령부가 내린 프로그램에서도 확인할 수 있었다.

프로그램에 따르면 국회의 지방의회, 정부의 활동과 정치적 결사, 집회, 시위 등 모든 정치활동은 금금하며 모든 언론자료는 계엄사령부에 제출 받아야만 하며 국민들의 입에 재갈을 물리게 하였다.

또한, 천공의 비호하에 국정의 제도를 운영한 이란 모든 의혹이었음은 48시간 내 본인의 복귀하며 위한 시 계엄법에 의해 ‘처단’할 것이라고 말했다.

대통령은 본인이 국민에게 계엄을 올리면 국민은 이를 용주해야 하며
그렇지 않은 국민들은 처단해야 할 대상이라고 생각하는가?

이와 더불어, 계엄이 선포되고 지난 나흘 동안 수많은 의식에서도 윤석열 대통령에 대한 반발은 멈추지 않고 있으며 이는 우리나라의 외교적 패쇄이자 굴욕이다.

마지막으로 국민의 생명과 재산은 누구보다 앞장서서 지켜야 할 대통령이
언제 또 계엄을 내릴까 노심초사하게 수많은 국민이 밤잠을 잃고 있다.

국민을 위한 대통령이 맞는지,
21세기에 현존하는 대통령이 맞는지,
더 나아가 그가 과연 대통령직을 더 이상 수행할 수 있을지
도무지 의심하지 않을 수 없다.

바라건대 혼란스런 국정이 어려움을 때마다 자주 대한민국을 수호하고
자유 언론 질서를 지켜 내기 위해 싸워주신 선배들 정가가 있어 오늘의 국민이 있으며
우리 대학은 부산 민주항쟁을 비롯 중립해낼 자랑스러운 역사가 있다.

우리는 결코 상아탑의 안온함에 자족하지 않는다. 오늘, 우리는 억제(抑制)의 격랑(激浪)에 맞서 이성과 진리를 무기로 삼는다. 우리의 양심은 명명백하다. 불의의 현실 앞에서 침묵할 수 없다. 자유의 비결은 용기뿐이다.

헌법 제69조 “나는 헌법을 수호하고 국가를 보위하며 조국의 평화적 통일과 국민의 자유와 복리의 증진 및 민족문화의 창달에 노력하여 대통령으로서의 직책을 성실히 수행할 것을 국민 앞에 엄숙히 선서합니다.”, 대통령 취임식에서 읊어진 국민 약속과 선서이건만, 윤석열의 이 선서는 철저히 배신됐다. 헌법을 수호하겠다는거 국민의 권리로 둔갑시킨 채, 법치주의와 민주주의의 근간을 흔들었다.

2024년 12월 3일, 윤석열은 헌법 제77조에 명시된 몇 요건을 충족하지 못하는 위험한 비상계엄을 선포했다. 계엄사령부는 계엄 프로그램을 통해 정치 결사의 자유를 포함한 구체적 국민 기본권과 언론의 입을 막았다. 이는 대한민국의 민주주의를 훼손하고 국민의 기본권을 심각하게 침해한 반민주적 폭거로, 결코 용납될 수 없다.

군대를 정치적 목적으로 동원한 것은 현장 질서에 대한 중대한 도전이다. 서울대학교의 학생이자 대한민국의 국민으로서 민주주의와 헌법을 지키기 위해, 총학은 오만에 가득찬 윤석열 대통령으로 인정할 수 없음을 강경히 선언한다.

서울대학교는 불의에 맞선 역사를 빛난다. 그 빛은 우리 대학 정신의 근간이자 시대가 요구하는 가치이다. 우리에게 주어진 사명은 명확하다. 우리는 모든 부정에 맞서 민주주의의 헌정 질서를 사수할 것이다. 민중 해방의 불꽃이여, 자유의 횃불이 되어 전제(專制)를 나와(裸火)를 밝히자. 억압의 밤을 걷지 말라. 자유를 향한 우리의 외침은 어둠을 내몰고 시대를 밝히는 광명이 될 것이다.

우리는 두려워하지 않는다. 불꽃은 헌정사 한가운데 그려졌다. 역사는 불의에 맞서 싸운 이들의 피로 쓰인 책이다. 우리는 그 책의 가장 용감한 장을 써야 한다. 아무리 깊은 억압도, 진리와 자유를 향한 우리의 열망을 꺾을 수 없다. 민주주의를 허물뿐인 외피로 전락시키려는 윤석열에게 묻는다.

계엄사는 포고령 제1호를 발령하며 모든 언론과 출판이 계엄사의 통제를 받도록 하였다. 우리는 신군부의 삼엄한 언론 통제가 대학언론에 가치를 불붙힌 1980년대의 역사를 기억한다. 계엄령이 해제되지 않았다면 대한민국의 모든 언론출판인은 보도 결단의 저취 아래 또다시 장악당했을 것이다.

오늘날 대학언론은 무슨 가치를 지니냐는 질문, 무엇을 할 수 있느냐는 의심은, 과연 살아남을 수 있느냐는 불안함은 끊임없이 마주해 왔다.

우리는 하고 싶은 말을 끝끝내 삼키는 심정을 알고 있다. 책임져야 할 미래가 두려워 문장을 지우는 마음을 알고 있다. 그러나 우리가 기억하는 것은 그뿐만이 아니다. 전경들이 편집실 문을 부수고 서적과 자료를 빼앗는 참혹 속에서도 펜대를 놓지 않았던 마음 역시 안다. 몇 번이고 넘겨보던 헌법 책을 들며 사수하여 인쇄해 여러 나전한 용기가 우리에게 지금의 자유를 가능하게 했다는 사실을 안다.

그래서 우리는 폭압적인 계엄 준동에 침묵할 수 없다. 우리는 기록과 투쟁의 용기를 이어 나갈 것이다. 우리는 선배들이 피 흘려 일군 학생언론의 역사를 포기하지 않을 것이다.

윤석열은 민주주의를 훼손하고 국민의 기본권을 철저히 짓밟은 불법 계엄에 책임을 지고 즉각 사퇴하라. 비상 계엄의 공모자들 역시 죗값을 치르라.

        desc: `2024년 12월 3일 22시 23분경, 윤석열 대통령은 비상계엄을 선포했다. 민주화 이전의 군부독재 시대 이후 44년 만의 일이다. 뒤이어 23시경, “계엄”이라는 표현과 함께 헌법에 명시된 국민들의 기본권을 제한하는 계엄사령부 포고령이 발표되었다. 그러함이 이날, 대한민국에 거주하는 모든 이들은 다만 자유와 안전, 그리고 일상을 지키기 위해 밤을 지새우는 상황을 지켜볼 수밖에 없었다.

우리는 국회의사당으로 경찰들이 물러들어 국회의원들의 출입을 통제하는 것을 목격했다. 뒤이어 무장한 계엄군의 위력이 함께 가세해 진입하여 의원들을 구속, 회의장으로 압송하기 하는 것을 똑똑히 보았다. 이윽고, 계엄령은 비헌법적이고 반민주적인 성향으로 유려한 국민들에게 공포와 치욕으로 명불고 있다. 윤석열 대통령이 이번 계엄사령부 포고령을 발표한 목적은 오로지 국민의 입을 틀어막기 위해서일 뿐이다. 계엄선포 당시 헌법에 명시된 전시·사변·내란 등의 엄격한 국가비상사태 조건은 단 하나도 충족되지 않았다. 심지어는 국회에서 탄핵소추안이 가결될 만큼의 민주적 정당성이 있었음에도 불구하고 계엄은 선포되었다. 이러한 국민들의 요구안은 길어지지 않았다. 국회의사당은 그대로라며, 윤석열 대통령은 계엄사령부 보고문 한 문단을 발표하고, 그 즉시 국회의장에게 계엄을 해제하겠다고 밝혔다. 그 시각 1시 30분경이었다.

12월 3일 이후의 집착스러운 계엄은, 계엄은 1990년 국회의원과 나라의 의지로 지켜낸 시민들의 생애에 가까스로 지켜진 명분과 가치를 무너뜨리는 신호탄과 같았다. 이러한 민주적 질서를 “계엄선포”를 통해 깨어낸 행위만큼이나, 2024년 현재로서의 시점에 실천적이고 투쟁적인 민주주의자의 실천의 역할이 얼마나 중요한지를 보여주었다. 우리는 이 시점에서, 당대의 민주주의자는 자신의 위치에서 자신의 역할과 사리사욕에 흔들리지 않는 민주주의적 실천이 필요함을 기억한다. 나아가 우리는 “강조적 소수자는 나는 질문” 실현 이후, 각자의 교육과 삶의 현장에서 정치를 자유로이 표현하며 이 땅에 가장 연대 지향할 수 있는 민주시민의 기틀 마련에 혼신의 힘을 다해 실천할 믿음만 마련한다.

한국예술종합학교 본부는 과거 독재 탈압과 저항했던 안가(구(舊)국가안전기획부) 건물에 있던 자리에서 출발해 현재의 모습을 갖췄다. 설레 내부들의 피와 어떤 역사 위에서 새롭게 피어난 열어가고 있는 청년 예술인으로서, 우린 현 상황을 좌시할 수 없다. 역사적 아픔과 헌신 속에서 피어나야 할 새로운 예술을 살아낼 것이다. 예술은 우리에게 용기를 준다. 나아가 우리는 “강조적 소수자는 나는 질문” 실현 이후, 각자의 교육과 삶의 현장에서 정치를 자유로이 표현하며 이 땅에 가장 연대 지향할 수 있는 민주시민의 기틀 마련에 혼신의 힘을 다해 실천할 믿음만 마련한다.

예술은 시대의 거울이며, 사회의 양심이다. 예술은 철저히 살아나는 삶에서 나오는 새로운 아름다움이며, 지금 여기의 명분이다. 예술의 역할을 기억하듯, 우리는 모든 부정에 맞서 민주주의의 헌정 질서를 사수할 것이다. 민중 해방의 불꽃이며, 자유의 확신이 되어 전체(齊體)로서 나와(齊體)를 방지하, 억압의 발을 끊지 않는다. 자유를 향한 우리의 외침은 이들을 내몰고 시대를 밝히는 광명이 될 것이다.

예술인으로서 우리는 이러한 행위에 침묵하지 않을 것이다. 우리는 앞선 삶을 산 이들의 피로 쓰인 있었던 나라의 예술이 지닌 가치를 분명히 선언한다. 우리는 역사 속 예술이 마음과 노래로 이어갈 것이며, 장르과 이미지를 채워올 것이다.

이것은 정치적 문제가 이전에 어떤 종류의 정지도 불가능하게 만든 극악무도한 탈계 초월한 삶의 문제이다. 그러니까, 이것은 인류의 문제다.

그리고 우리는 민주주의적 정의를 역행하는 모든 시도에 책임을 물을 것이고 끝까지 저항할 것이다. 예술은 권력의 억압에 굴하지 않는다.

법적요건도 채 갖추지 못한 계엄을 선포해 놓고 야당의 폭거를 시민에게 알리려 했다는 변명이 가당기나 한가. 시민의 자유를 볼모로 정권만연을 자행한 윤석열 자신이 바로 대한민국의 타락할 수 없는 반국가 세력이라는 것을 아직도 자각하지 못했는가. 시민을 기망한 후안무치한 자가 아직도 얼국의 대통령이라니. 국회는 시민들의 뜻을 이어받아 망국의 원흉 윤석열을 탄핵하라.

윤석열은 ‘자유민주주의’, ‘반국가’라는 수사로 국익이 주권자인 시민의 ‘정치’, ‘참여’, 표현의 자유를 짓밟았다. 그가 말하는 ‘자유’는 정치적 자유를 정치참여의 회피로 오도하는 내용에 불과했다. 우리의 몸과 국가권력이 얽혀 추동되지 않는 이상 그것은 부러진 허망한 소리에 불과하다. 주디스 버틀러는 말한다. “우리가 가진 단 하나의 삶을 마침내 살아낼 만한 것으로 만드는 조건. 그것은 우리가 자유를 쟁취하는 것. 구속받고 있는 우리의 이 몸으로 투쟁하는 것이다.”

이 땅에서 누구보다도 자유를 갈망하는 이는 소수자다. 우리는 알고 있다. 자유가 사라진 이 땅에서 가장 먼저 밟밟아밟는 자가 소수자란 것을. 그 동안 우리는 다수의 권리를 침해한다는 명목으로 소수자의 자유를 제한해 왔다. 소수자의 의회는 언제적 합의가 부족하다는 이유로 삭제해 왔다. 다른 소수자를 외면해온 지금의 국회나, 비상계엄을 선포한 윤석열에게 마찬가지이다. 그러나 평생을 국가의 2% 시민으로 살아온 소수자가 국회에 고한다. 이제 시민 다수의 자유마저 억압하려는 윤석열을 탄핵하라.

그리고 이 땅의 소수자에게 고한다. 우리는 이미 충분히 철저히 자신을 숨기고, 속이고, 부인해왔다. 그러나 오늘만큼은 우리의 억압된 신체를 해방하자. 우리의 자유를 쟁취하자. 시민사회는 그간 소수자의 외침으로 진보해 왔으며, 우리 함께 변화을 이룩하자. 이 땅의 소수자가 그리는 자유의 몸짓에 성소수도 함께하겠다.

오늘은 시민이 승리할 것이다.

헌법 파괴와 내란 행위에 대한 우리의 입장

현재 대한민국에서 벌어지고 있는 반헌법적 사태는 우리 사회의 민주적 가치와 헌법 질서를 심각하게 훼손하고 있습니다. 국회에 대한 폭력, 국민의 생명과 안전을 위협하는 군사적 행위, 그리고 헌법 기관의 기능을 마비시키려는 시도는 명백한 내란 행위입니다.

우리는 이러한 행위가 단순한 정치적 갈등이 아니라 헌법과 민주주의 근간을 흔드는 심각한 내란 행위임을 분명히 인식합니다. 강서대학교 학생들은 이 사태에 대해 책임자들을 엄정히 처벌하고 국가 질서의 복원을 강력히 요구합니다.

학생의 권리와 학문의 자유를 지키기 위한 우리의 다짐

강서대학교는 1958년 개교 이래, 학문과 진리를 통해 사회에 공헌해온 수많은 인재를 배출해온 역사 깊은 대학입니다. 그러나 최근 벌어진 일련의 사태는 학생의 자유와 학문의 권리가 심각히 위협됨을 보여주고 있습니다.

강서대학교 학생들은 학문적 자유와 권리를 지키기 위해, 민주주의 질서의 복원과 헌법적 가치를 수호하는 데 최선을 다할 것입니다. 우리는 단순한 학생 집단이 아니라, 민주주의의 한 축으로서 책임과 사명을 가지고 행동할 것입니다. 강서대학교 학생비상대책위원회 입장은 오직 민주주의와 정의를 회복하는 데 기여함을 기어이 밝힙니다.

윤석열 대통령 퇴진을 포함한 우리의 요구사항

강서대학교 총학생회비상대책위원회는 대한민국의 민주적 질서를 파괴한 윤석열 대통령의 책임을 묻습니다. 대통령은 헌법 수호자로서 국민의 권리와 국회의 기능을 보호해야 할 책무를 가지고 있습니다. 하지만 현 사태에서 드러난 행위는 그 본분이 아니라 권력 유지의 사리적 탐욕에 불과합니다.

이에 우리는 다음과 같이 요구합니다.

하나. 헌법을 위반한 내란 행위에 가담한 모든 관련자를 철저히 조사하고 법적으로 처벌하라.
하나. 국민의 생명과 안전을 보장하며, 민주적 자유를 침해하지 않는 민주적 질서를 즉각 회복하라.
하나. 윤석열 대통령은 즉각 퇴진하고, 민주주의 질서를 복원하기 위한 국가적 책임을 다하라.

강서대학교의 열망과 약속

강서대학교 총학생회비상대책위원회는 이번 선언을 통해 우리의 목소리를 전국에 전달할 것입니다. 이 선언은 단순한 한 학교의 외침이 아닙니다. 우리의 목소리는 민주주의 회복을 위한 실천에서 비롯한 다짐입니다.

우리는 침묵하지 않을 것입니다. 강서대학교의 이름으로 학생과 사회의 권리를 지키기 위한 행동을 이어갈 것입니다. 민주주의의 회복은 우리의 현재와 미래를 위한 필수 과제이며, 이를 위해 우리는 끝까지 노력할 것을 다짐합니다.

2024년, 우리는 다시 한번 어두운 현실을 직면하였습니다.
2024년 12월 3일, 윤석열 대통령은 반국가 세력에 맞서 대한민국을 지키겠다는 명분 하에 계엄을 선포하였습니다.
계엄사령부는 프로그램 제1호를 통해 국회의 지방의회, 정당 활동, 정치적 결제, 집회 및 시위를 전면 금지하고, 언론과 출판을 통제하겠다고 밝혔습니다.
헌법상 계엄령은 법령에 규정한 전시, 사변 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태에만 허용되는 조치입니다.
그러나 윤석열 대통령은 요건이 충족되지 않은 상황에서 비상계엄을 선포하였습니다.

대통령의 권한은 개인의 것이 아닌 국민으로부터 나온 권력입니다.
비상계엄은 독재적 권력을 사용해 국민의 자유를 억압하는 수단으로, 우리는 44년 만에 어두운 과거를 다시 마주하였습니다.
계엄령 하에서는 법치주의가 무너지고, 국민의 기본권이 제한되며, 언론과 집회의 자유는 봉인으로 가득한 칠흑 같은 어둠에 묻힙니다.
국민의 자유와 권리를 지킬 의무가 있는 자가 대통령이 국민을 억압해야 할 같은 행동이라 자신의 권력을 과시하며 발암을 조성하였습니다.
우리는 2024년 다시 한번, 민주주의라는 이름이 한낱 말로 남을 현실을 견뎌내야했습니다.
계엄은 일시적으로 해제되었지만 우리는 민주주의 한 순간에 무너질 수 있음을 두 눈으로 똑똑히 보았습니다.

교육을 세상에 퍼뜨릴 자, 내일을 위해 목소리를 내겠습니다.
예비 교사로서 우리는 이 모든 상황을 묵과할 수 없습니다.
자주추천교육대학교는 “인간을 가슴에, 교육을 세상에”라는 믿음을 받아안습니다.
우리는 그 어떠한 상황에서도 민주주의의 가치를 가슴에 지녀야 할 교육자이자 시민이자 학생입니다.
우리는 헌법을 수호할 국가적 가교가 되며, 힘 있고 떳떳이 교육할 수 있어야 합니다.
민주주의의 가르침을 미래로 잇기 위해 우리는 목소리를 높여서, 추천교육대학교 예비교사들은 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포를 규탄하며, 윤석열 대통령의 탄핵을 촉구합니다.

잘못된 역사가 반복되고 있는 현재의 대한민국,
잘못된 일을 바로잡는 것이 우리의 역할입니다.
이에 윤석열 대통령의 위헌적 행동에 대한 책임임을 질 것을 촉구합니다.

우리는 부모를 고통받게 한 한밤 반도 집회에서 태어났다.
우리는 촛불을 들고 이 땅의 불의를 저항해왔다.
우리는 다시금 밤하늘에 촛불을 띄운다.
눈을 틔워 어여쁘도록 보아라, 민주주의의 품에서 피어난 촛불을.”

지난 12월 3일, 윤석열 대통령이 선포한 비상계엄은 헌법 정신을 저버리고 민주주의를 파괴한 명백히 내란 행위이다.
이에 한국외국어대학교 서울캠퍼스 총학생회 중앙운영위원회는 투쟁의 후예로서 투쟁의 윤석열 대통령에게 ‘진정성 있는 사과’와 ‘진상 규명’을 요구했으나, 돌아온 것은 내부자의 언론사 의표과 양식판문이었다.
우리는 다만 민주주의의 품에서 피어난 촛불을 눈동자에 새기듯이 기록할 것이다.

그대는 헌법과 국민 앞에 타협했던 책임을 잊었다
12월 7일, 윤석열 대통령은 대국민 담화에서 “업무 문제를 포함한 정책 운영은 향후 국정 운영은 당과 정부가 함께 책임질 것”이라 발표했다.
이는 자신의 책무와 헌신 수호의 의지를 포기한 비참한 내용이었다.
국민은 세대의 구분 없이 깊은 회의감과 분노했으며, 이에 대통령의 결단은 특정 정당이나 당론에 종속될 수 없다.
우리는 세계에 전한다. 국민의 일을 저버린 대통령으로 인정할 수 없다.

그대들은 당론에 파묻힌 국민의 목소리를 외면했다
국회법 제4조 제2조(4신)는 “국가이익을 수호하면서 국회의원의 직무를 양심에 따라 성실히 수행해 줄 국민 앞에 선서한 바”라고 되어있다.
그러나 12월 7일, 국회 본회의에서 여당 국회의원 대다수는 입장하지 않았다.
이는 국회의원의 의무를 스스로 부정하며 대한민국의 국민주주의 근간을 흔드는 중대한 헌정 파괴 행위이다.
불평등 표결로 과반수만이 이들이 배임의 죄로 징계받게 했으며, 국회의원의 양심과 의무의 목소리만큼의 수단은 결코 외면할 수 없다.
우리는 세계에 전한다. 국민의 일에 고개를 빠지거나 시선을 피하는 자로 인정할 수 없다.

기나긴 투쟁의 역사, 그대들이 지켜낸 오늘날의 민주주의
국민의 피와 땀으로 쟁취한 대한민국 민주주의는 나약한 추상이 아니다.
그러나 12월 3일 비상계엄 선포와 12월 7일 탄핵소추안 투표 불성실은 민주주의의 보호를 보여주었다.
민주주의를 수호할 진보는 국민의 대표라는 이름 가진 자들이 법망 속에 침몰하지 않을 때만 가능하다.
우리는 지금 이러한 사태를 직면해 있음을 안다.
우리는 ‘민주주의의 품에서 피어난 제2의 촛불’이자, 매 구성원의 탄핵된 민주주의를 향한 민주주의의 승리를 다시 한번 쟁취하고자 다짐하고 있다.

하나. 윤석열 대통령은 국가 혼란과 기만행위를 책임지고 대통령직에서 물러나라.
하나. 여당 국회의원들은 국민의 대표로서의 책무 불이행을 사죄하고 국민의 뜻을 반영하라.

2024년 12월 3일, 국가 권력은 국민을 지키는 본래의 책임을 저버리고, 국민의 대표기관인 국회를 거부했습니다. 비상계엄 선포는 국민의 동의는 커녕 절차적 정당성조차 결여된 채 진행되었습니다. 이를 알았던 공직자들조차 국회 일부에 불과했습니다.

우리는 그저 정치적 이해관계를 따지려는 것이 아닙니다. 이번 계엄 사태는 대한민국을 수호하기 위해 국군으로 소집된 ‘나의 친구들’이 ‘우리’에게 눈물의 총구를 겨눌 수 있는 끔찍한 사태로 번질 수 있는 일이었습니다.

단순히, 우리만의 일이 아닙니다. 우리의 조부모님 세대는 전쟁의 역사를, 우리 부모님 세대는 독재의 역사를 겪었습니다. 지금의 청년인 우리뿐만 아니라 역사 속 청년이었던 그들의 아픔이 현대 사회를 살아가면서 반복되어선 안 될 것입니다.

이번 사태를 통해 대응하는 것은 지금까지입니다. 현재 국민을 위협하거나 탄압하는 권력에 단 것이 이번만 존재할 수 없습니다. 그 과정에서 헌법과 민주주의 원칙은 무시되었습니다. 국가 운영의 기본 원칙인 투명성과 책임은 어디에서도 찾을 수 없었습니다.

과거의 청년들이 그랬듯 우리도 이제는 행동할 때입니다.

전국 83개의 대학 전현직 총학생회는 입법 및 사법기관에 다음과 같은 요구안을 제시하고자 합니다.

첫째, 비상계엄 선포의 이유를 명확히 밝혀주십시오.

        desc: `2024년 12월 3일, 윤석열 대통령이 비상계엄을 선포했다. 헌법이 보장하는 기본권과 민주주의의 가치를 무시한 채 국민을 군홧발 아래 억압하려는 시도가 대한민국 전역에서 벌어졌다. 이는 헌법적 절차를 무시한 위험적 조치로, 자유와 평등의 가치를 근본으로 삼는 대한민국의 민주주의를 정면으로 훼손한 행위이다.

비상계엄은 명분으로 국회를 침탈하고, 언론을 통제하며, 국민의 정치적 자유를 억압한 행위로는 군사정권 시대를 연상케 하는 비민주적 폭거이다. 대통령의 권력은 헌법과 국민으로부터 위임받은 것이며, 국민의 기본권과 헌정 질서를 수호할 책임이 대통령에 있다는 사실을 다시 한 번 상기해야 한다.

대구교육대학교는 예비교사로서 민주주의의 가치를 배우고 가르치는 곳이다. 우리 예비교사들은 미래의 효소임을 책임질 사람으로서, 정의와 평등, 자유의 가치를 미래 세대에 전해야 하는 사명을 지니고 있다. 그러나 대통령이 스스로 헌법적 가치를 저버리는 현실 앞에서 침묵하는 것은 예비교사로서, 대한민국 국민으로서 연대의 책임을 저버리는 일이다.

우리는 오늘 대한민국 민주주의가 흔들리는 이 순간을 목도하며, 침묵의 불의에 동조하는 것임을 분명히 인식한다. 이에 우리는 아래와 같이 선언한다.

하나, 윤석열 대통령의 위헌적 비상계엄 선포를 단호히 규탄하며, 그 즉각적 책임을 강력히 요구한다.

하나, 헌법 수호 의무를 저버린 윤석열 대통령의 퇴진을 요구한다.

하나, 민주주의를 지키기 위한 모든 정당한 행동에 동참할 것을 선언한다.

우리는 대한민국의 민주주의가 결코 권력자의 독단과 오만에 의해 훼손될 수 없음을 선언한다. 교육은 사회의 거울이며, 교육자가 침묵할 때 세상은 어둠 속으로 빠져들기 마련이다. 우리는 예비교사로서 그리고 대한민국 국민으로서 연대와 행동을 통해 대한민국 민주주의를 수호하고 미래 세대에게 자유와 평등의 가치를 가르칠 것이다.

        desc: `노동권 보장을 위한 윤석열 퇴진, ‘국민’에서 배제되어온 존재들과 함께 만들어가자

지난 12월 3일(일) 밤, 윤석열 대통령은 전시·사변에 준하는 상황이 아님에도 비상계엄을 선포했다. 계엄법에 보이는 계엄사령부사령관 1호 지령은 국회와 정부 주요 부처를 군 점령하라는 시도였으며, 시민의 생명·안전을 저해할 경찰과 국군을 총동원해 각종 예산을 빼돌리며 국민의 노동권을 침해하는 지도부를 비호할 무리한 인사로 해석되며, 이는 이번에 더해진 한·미 동맹과 한일 군사협정 등, 그리고 노동권을 억압하려는 새로운 시도의 연장선임에 분명해 보인다.

민주주의의 이름으로 노동의 당연함에 대해 여전히 권리마저도 부정하려는 시도에 시민들은 크게 분노했다. 계엄 직후 국회의장실에 수십 명의 의원이 모여 대통령의 퇴진을 촉구했다. 전국에서는 전국노동조합총연맹과 비정규직노동조합, 각종 인권단체와 전국학생총연대는 지난 12월 7일(목) 100만 명이 넘는 인원이 모여 대통령 퇴진과 노동권 보장을 외쳤다. 그런데 이 자리에 우리는 보지 못한 이들이 있었다. 서울대 노동조합, 병원노동조합, 학내 청소노동자 등 소위 ‘국민’이라는 말에서 배제되어온 존재들이었으며, 이날 계엄 직후부터 모여 탄핵과 퇴진을 촉구했던 그 자리에 이들의 이름은 존재하지 않았다. 우리는 지금도 노동운동 현장뿐 아니라 학생, 인권운동 현장 모두에서 노동운동을 포함한 각종 권리보장 운동이 시민의 이름으로 불려야 한다고 믿고 있다.

그러나 12월 7일 밤, 윤석열이 이미 내린 여당 국민의힘의 시민의 뜻을 왜곡했다. 민간인 노동 운동을 정치기계처럼 반대할 폭거가 아니라 어느새 자신의 안위와 이익을 위해 고려하던 머리만 남은 당으로 전락해버렸다는 것이다. 이는 반대하는 자치를 손쉽게 없애는 자임을, 사실상의 동조요 공범임을 의미했다.

우리는 1961년 5·16 쿠데타 이후 비상계엄하에서 1.4명의으로 부활한 민주노조운동이 어떻게 전환했는지, 전국영광초과 노동조합의 조직으로 재편되자 어떻게 새로운 청년세력과 시민혁명으로 넘어갔는지 생생히 알고 있다. 1980년 5월 18일, 민주노동운동자들은 전남에서 학살되었다. 1987년 노동자대투쟁은 민간 인권운동이 노동권을 포함한 권리보장 운동으로 변모했음을 입증한 역사적 전환점이었다. 5·17 이후부터 이어진 수많은 시위와 투쟁에서 노동권은 단순한 ‘직업적 협상’이 아니라 시민권과 민주주의를 위한 싸움이었다. 우리는 세대를 뛰어넘어, 전국적 규모로 함께 모여야 하며, 오늘 87년 이후를 살아가는 우리는 모두 이 역사의식을 반드시 되새겨야 한다고 느끼고 있다.

계엄과 폭력에도 노동운동과 비정규직의 역사를 기억하는 우리는 국민의힘의 내란 동조를 규탄해낼 수 없다. 법과 질서로 신뢰받은 시민이자 권리를 주장하는 우리는 권리로서의 노동권을 보장할 것을 촉구한다. 더는 국회와 대통령, 그리고 권력자들이 우리를 ‘국민’에서 제외하지 못하도록 목소리를 내겠다. 우리는 여전히 ‘국민’이 아니더라도, 모두 권리와 노동을 함께 만들어가는 존재임을 자각하고자 한다.

아아, 우리는 끝내 ‘국민’이 아니다. 그러나 지금까지 수차례의 혁명에서 민주주의와 인권을 새로 세워낸 역사의 계승자이다. 오늘도 ‘국민’이라 불리지 않던 사람들이 모여 여전히 자신의 권리를 요구하며 노동권을 외치고, 인권을 외치며, 윤석열 퇴진을 외치고 있다. 우리에겐 법과 질서, 그리고 국민의 이름으로 이루어지지 않은 권리와 역사가 있기에, 우리는 더 당당히 일어서서 함께 목소리를 내고자 한다.

마지막으로 우리는 오늘의 역사를 과거의 역사와 묶고 되짚어 국민의힘 의원들에게 외친다. ‘국민’이라 내란 동조를 비호하려 하지 말고, 우리는 반대에 이어 함께이기에 더 외칠 수 있음을, 오로지 우리가 세상을 새로 그려낼 자임을.

신한대학교 제5대 총학생회는 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포를 강력히 규탄한다.

2024년 12월 3일 22시 23분, 대국민담화를 통해 윤석열 대통령은 헌법질서 전반에 비상계엄이 선포되었다고 발표했다. 이는 헌법에 명시한 특회의 계엄선포 필요 요건과 불분명하며, 국가 비상사태의 기준을 충족하지 않은 상황에서 이루어진 조치이다.

본회의 회원은 헌법에 명시된 권리를 보장받는다.
신한대학교 총학생회칙 제5조(회원 권리와 의무) 中

신한대학교 제5대 총학생회는 대한민국 헌법에 명령된 헌법질서를 보호받아야 할 국민과 학생들의 권리가 찬탈당했다는 사실에 깊은 분노를 느낀다. 우리의 조상들, 민주주의를 위해 싸운 선조들의 헌신이 헌법 속에 담겨 있으며, 헌법질서의 가치를 심각하게 훼손한 이번 사태는 모든 국민과 학생들의 권리와 자유를 위협하는 심각한 사안이다.

신한대학교 제5대 총학생회는 학생과 국민의 권리를 보장하고자 모든 국민과 학생들의 권리를 지키기 위해 부단한 목소리와 교류한다. 권리를 지키기 위해 목소리를 낼 것이며, 국민과 학생들의 정당한 권리를 수호할 것이다.

대통령을 비롯하여 국민 탄압에 관여한 모든 인사들은 국민의 목소리도 듣고, 지금의 사태가 재발되지 않을 안전한 대한민국을 위해 헌법적 책임을 다하여 이번 사태를 해결할 것을 촉구한다.

“국민의 자유와 안전 그리고 국가 유지 가능성”이라는 명분과 국민의 기본권을 탄압한 ‘비상계엄’이라는 단어는 절대 공존할 수 없다.

신한대학교 제5대 총학생회는 대한민국 민주주의를 지키기 위해, 무엇보다 신한대학교 학생들은 지키기 위해 헌법적 목소리로 내야 하는 엄중한 시대적 과제에 직면했다는 점을 공감한다. 굳건한 조직적 목소리로 민주주의의 본질과 가치를 수호할 것이며, 또한, 위협으로 이어질 여지가 마련되면 즉각적인 책임을 이끌어낼 것이다.

혼란 속에서도 민주적 가치와 자유로운 사회를 위해 목소리를 크게 외친겠다.
우리는 신한대학교 제5대 총학생회이며, 신뢰와 책임은 대한민국 민주주의의 본보기가 되었고자 한다.

우리는 최근 대한민국에서 벌어진 비상계엄 선포 사례를 규탄하며, 민주주의의 헌정 질서가 심각한 위협에 처했음을 느꼈다. 대학은 진리와 자유의 공간이며, 자유민주주의 가치가 훼손되지 않고 지켜지겠다고 목소리를 낸다.

[윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포는 전시·사변 또는 이에 준하는 국가비상사태였는가?]
2024년 12월 3일 22시 23분, 윤 대통령의 비상계엄 선포는 국민에게 구체적이고 이해할 만한 설명이 이루어졌으며 헌법적 질서를 훼손한 행위였다. 헌법 제77조 제1항, 계엄법 제2조 제2항에 따라 이는 대한민국 민주주의 근간을 흔드는 헌법적 위협 행위였다.

[민주주의를 짓밟는 행위와 권력남용을 용납할 수 없다.]
계엄하에서는 포고 제1호를 통해 집회와 시위행위, 장염의 활동과 정치적 결사, 집회, 시위 등 일체의 정치활동을 금하며, 보도언론 출판의 자유를 제한했다. 이번 비상계엄은 국민의 기본권을 심각하게 훼손한 행위였다. 헌법에 명시된 국민의 권리를 훼손한 국권을 국민은 용납할 수 없다. 계엄기관이 일반법원에 대한 권한을 넘어서는 행위에 헌법기관인 국회를 불법으로 겁잡하고자 하였다. 이는 헌법에 명시된 바에 따른 절차적 절차를 거치지 아니하였으며, 자유민주적 헌정 질서를 짓밟는 위헌 행위임이 분명하다.

[우리는 헌법과 법률을 훼손한 책임자들에게 합당한 처벌을 요구한다.]
비상계엄 선포는 헌법적 가치를 훼손하며 대한민국 민주주의 근간을 무너뜨리는 행위였다. 이에 우리는 비상계엄과 관련한 책임자를 엄히 조사해 밝히고 지속적인 사처를 요구한다. 국민 탄압에 관여한 모든 인사를 철저히 조사하고 책임을 물어야 한다.

호서대학교 총학생회는 대한민국의 자유를 수호하려는 우리의 걸음을 결코 멈추지 않을 것이며, 민주주의를 파괴하려는 모든 행위에 저항할 것이다. 국가 권력이 국민의 신뢰를 저버린다면 우리는 결연히 행동할 것이며, 불의와 타협하지 않을 것이다.

우리는 윤석열 대통령의 민주주의 가치 훼손과 헌정질서 유린을 강력히 규탄한다.

대한민국의 헌법 질서가 무너지는 현장을 우리는 지켜보지만은 않을 것이다.
2024년 12월 3일 22시 27분, 45년 만에 선포된 비상계엄령은 전 국민을 국가에 대한 불신과 불안의 수렁에 빠뜨리기에 충분했다. 횃기와 흩날리는 연기로 방화물은 수놓을 별들로 가리며 국민의 일상을 위협하였다. 계엄사령부 포고제1호에 의하면 국민의 일상에 직·간접적으로 통제와 검열, 집회, 시위, 정치 활동 등 일체의 정당 활동을 금하였고, 보도 언론과 출판의 자유를 제한하였다. 현정 질서를 무너뜨리려는 반국가세력을 척결한다는 명분 아래 시행된 이와 같은 참사는 스스로 반헌법적인 폭력을 일으키며 종국을 보는 독재자의 말로를 떠올리게 하며 후일 교과서에 실리게 될 것이다.

우리는 眞理를 탐구해야 하는 교육대학생이다.
우리는 학문의 전당에서 진리를 탐구하고 올바른 길을 가르칠 예비교사로서, 무엇보다도 진실을 밝히는 것이, 우리의 사명이라 자부할 것이다. 5·18의 빛나는 역사의 산실 광주에서 반복적인 참사를 일으킨 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄령은 5·18이라는 어둠이 드리웠던 광주 지역에 대한 자성을 남길 것이다. 진실을 볼 눈을 가리는 시도였으며, 거짓을 구분할 수 있는 귀를 닫으려 한 것이다. 또한 올바름을 말할 입을 막아 우리를 무력하게 할 진리를 가렸다.

우리는 正義롭게 행동하는 교육대학생이다.
우리는 정의로운 민주주의의 횃불을 밝힐 예비교사로서 우리들의 소명을 다하고자 한다. 우리는 이 나라의 미래를 길러낼 불씨이며 불길로 삼켜버릴 거대한 학염으로써 무언의 난세를 이겨내야 한다. 광주교육대학교의 선배 교원 양성자들의 정신은 이미 우리가 가르칠 교단을 수호하기 위해 살아있다. 아이들과 함께하는 공간에서 잘못된 폭력을 가르치는 마음으로 가르칠 수 없듯이 우리는 정의로워야만 가르쳐야 한다.

우리는 자랑스러운 스승의 길을 걷는 교육대학생이다.
우리는 지금의 혼돈 속에서도 역사를 바르게 기록하기 위해 교사가 되기 위해 예비교사의 소명을 다하고자 한다. 우리는 진리를 탐구하는 교육대학생으로서 어떤 사태에 대한 진실을 밝히고자 할 것이며, 우리의 정의의 피만 민주주의의 헌정 질서를 수호하기 위해 할것임을 밝힌다. 우리는 자랑스러운 스승의 길을 걷고 있을 것이다. 지금의 위기에서 벗어나올 것이다. 우리가 가르칠 역사를 바라보는 건 우리, 예비교사들이다. 이 가치는 힘이자 권리이다.

하지만 대통령의 성명에는 진정한 사과도, 어떠한 책임의 통감도 없었습니다. 민주주의를 빼앗긴 헌정 질서는 여전히 복원되지 않았습니다. 불안정한 정국 속에서 대한민국 국민들은 두려움과 불안감에 빠져 있습니다. 게다가 지난 12월 7일 여당 의원 105명의 탄핵에 대한 찬반 의사를 밝히지 않고 본회의장을 이탈함으로써 표결이 무산되었습니다. 그렇기에 2024년 지금의 우리는 1987년 대한민국 곳곳에서 시민 모두가 목소리를 높이며 외쳤던, 민주주의의 소리를 다시 한번 되새기고자 합니다.

윤석열 대통령의 국정을 바라보며 신중함을 기하던 대학생과 청년들마저 이제는 대통령에 대한 묵묵한 신뢰의 기대를 거둬들였습니다. 불안정한 정국 속에서 대한민국 국민들은 두려움과 불안감에 빠져 있습니다. 대통령이 선포한 불법 계엄은 우리의 평화로운 일상을 앗아갔고, 이에 분노한 민심은 걷잡을 수 없이 커져 무섭게 소용돌이치고 있습니다. 추운 겨울 날씨에도 우리의 친구들, 부모님들, 이웃들, 어르신들이 다시 한번 거리로 나가는 이유는 독재와 폭력이 아닌 자유와 민주주의로 국정이 운영되는 나라를 꿈꾸기 때문입니다. 헌법이 보장한 국민의 자유와 권리는 그 누구도 빼앗을 수 없다는 것을 확인시키기 위해서입니다.

나라를 분열시키고 헌법을 위반한 대통령과 계엄 관련자들을 즉각 퇴진시키고 그에 대한 책임을 명백하게 물어야 합니다. 대통령의 불법 계엄 선포 이후 대한민국은 혼란 속에 빠졌습니다. 조금의 독립과 민주화를 위해, 생존과 번영을 위해 헌신한 우리의 선열과 선배들의 노력이 짓밟혔습니다. 적대감과 분노만이 만연해진 한국 사회 속에서 현실과 괴리되어 버린 민주주의를 지키기 위해, 우리는 우리의 선배들이 그려놓았듯이 다시 한번 목소리를 내고자 합니다. 우리는 대학에서 학문을 탐구하고 정의를 추구하는 미래세대로서 이번 사태를 절대 좌시하지 않고, 윤석열 대통령과 계엄 관련자들의 책임을 계속해서 요구할 것입니다.

존경하는 전국의 모든 대학생 시민 여러분, 우리는 다시 거리에 나왔습니다. 이번 사태는 특정 세대와 이번에 국한된 문제가 아닙니다. 민주주의는 우리 모두의 노력으로 성취한 것입니다. 민주주의를 수호하기 위해 다시 모두의 노력이 필요한 시점입니다. 이에 우리는 학생으로서, 또 한 명의 시민으로서 모든 시민과 뜻을 함께해 평화적 저항을 이어갈 것을 결의하며, 다음과 같이 요구합니다.

—

하나. 반헌법적이고 비민주적인 비상계엄을 선포한 윤석열 대통령은 즉각 퇴진하라.
하나. 대한민국 헌정 질서를 파괴하고 민주주의를 위협한 윤석열 대통령과 계엄 관계자들을 엄벌하라.
하나. 모든 정치인은 국민이 위임한 민주적 권력을 헌정 질서 회복과 정국 안정을 위해 올바르게 사용하라.

“국민과 국가를 위한 결단에 감사의 뜻을 전하며”

오늘, 대한민국 정치사에 한 획을 긋는 중대한 결정을 마주하며, 그동안의 노력과 수고에 깊은 경의를 표합니다. 윤석열 대통령 탄핵안의 가결은 우리나라 민주주의가 작동하는 모습을 명확히 보여준 중요한 순간이었습니다. 이 과정에서 쉽지 않은 선택의 기로에 서 있었던 분들께서 소속 정당의 논리를 넘어, 국가와 국민의 이익을 우선으로 한 결단을 내려주셨습니다. 이는 결코 가벼운 선택이 아니었으며, 민주주의의 가치를 지키기 위한 무거운 책임감을 보여준 행동이었습니다.

여러분의 결정은 대한민국 정치의 새로운 기준을 세우는 중요한 이정표가 되었습니다. 이는 단순히 한 사건에 대한 대응이 아니라, 국민의 신뢰를 회복하고 미래를 위한 초석을 다지는 중요한 계기입니다. 어려운 상황 속에서도 보여주신 책임감과 헌신은 국민 모두에게 큰 메시지를 전달했습니다. 대한민국의 정치가 국민과 함께 호흡하며 올바른 방향으로 나아갈 수 있음을 증명하셨습니다.

특히, 여당으로서 현실적 제약과 정치적 부담 속에서도 국민을 위한 용기 있는 결정을 내려주신 국민의힘 의원 12인 이상을 포함한 모든 국회의원 여러분의 노고에 진심으로 감사를 드립니다.

저는 원광대학교 학생들을 대표하는 총학생회장이지 대한민국 국민으로서, 이번 결정을 통해 보여주신 헌신과 책임감에 깊은 감사의 뜻을 표합니다. 이러한 결단은 대한민국 정치와 민주주의의 발전에 있어 매우 중요한 의미를 지닌다고 믿습니다.

앞으로의 길 역시 순탄치 않을 것입니다. 그러나 오늘의 선택이 대한민국 정치와 사회의 발전에 있어 소중한 한 걸음이 되리라 믿습니다. 여러분의 수고는 국민 모두가 기억할 것이며, 이는 우리 사회가 더욱 단단히 나아가는 데 기여할 것입니다.

다시 한 번, 대한민국을 위한 여러분의 노고와 결단에 감사와 경의를 표합니다. 이 중요한 순간을 만들어낸 여러분의 수고를 진심으로 인정하며, 앞으로도 대한민국이 더 나은 방향으로 나아가기를 기원합니다.

변화가 시작된 이화의 2024년을 만들어주셔서 감사합니다.

12월 3일 윤석열 대통령의 비상 계엄령 선포 이후, 12월 4일 진행했던 총학생회와 14개 단과대학, 동아리연합회가 함께한 시국선언부터, 12월 5일 300명의 이화인이 참여해서 시국선언 기자회견, 그 이후 1000명이 넘는 이화인 개인 명의 대자보, 학내 단위 릴레이 성명지, 학내 180명의 이화인 시국선언, 그리고 12월 13일 2600명의 이화인이 만들어낸 학생총회 성사와 12월 14일 윤석열 탄핵 소추안 가결까지. 이화를 변화가 시작되는 곳으로 만들어주신 15000 이화인 여러분께 깊은 감사와 인사 드립니다.

학생총회 2600명의 불빛이 윤석열 탄핵의 불빛으로

12월 3일 윤석열 대통령 비상 계엄 선포 이후 이화인들은 다양한 방식으로 행동하며 민주주의와 해방의 역사를 거쳐나갔고 지켜내고자 했습니다. 이화인의 변함없는 움직임은 기어코 12월 13일 학생총회 2600명의 성사로 이어졌고, 12월 14일 윤석열 대통령 탄핵 소추안 가결까지 나아갔습니다. 대통령을 탄핵할 수순으로 가기까지는 촛불을 멈추지 않았습니다. 민주주의의 해방 역사를 만들어가고 있던 윤석열 대통령을 탄핵시킨 것은 민주주의와 해방의 역사를 만들고 지켜내려고 했던 해방이화의 역사자, 2024년 현재의 15000 이화인이었습니다.

해방이화의 불빛이 민주주의의 불빛을 밝힐 때까지

윤석열 대통령 탄핵 소추안은 가결되었지만, 이는 끝이 아닌 시작입니다. 비상 계엄 선포는 명백한 헌정 질서 파괴행위였습니다. 이제껏 민주주의를 훼손하려는 사람들은 제도화와 처벌 끝까지 우리의 변화를 향한 움직임을 멈춰서는 안 됩니다. 12월 13일 2600명의 불빛이 12월 14일 윤석열 탄핵의 불빛으로 번졌던 그날처럼, 해방이화의 불빛이 민주주의 불빛을 밝힐 때까지 거리를 나가겠습니다.

민주주의를 지켜낸 역사의 순간에 예비교사들이 함께했습니다.

12월 3일 비상계엄이 선포된 이후 예비교사들은 행동했습니다. 11개의 교육대학 및 초등교육과가 윤석열 대통령의 비상계엄 선포를 규탄하는 시국선언만 명명문을 시작으로, 전국 초중교원양성대학 모든 곳에서 시국선언을 발표했고, 5개의 교육대학원에서는 학우들과 함께 시국선언 기자회견을 진행했습니다.
위험적, 위협적 비상계엄을 가만히 두고 보지 않겠다는 예비교사들의 다짐이었고, 가만히 두고 보아서는 안된다는 예비교사들의 사명감이었습니다. 대통령의 책임을 촉구하는 목소리는 대학을 넘어 전국 곳곳에서 열린 집회 현장의 열기로 이어졌습니다.

예비교사들은 헌법재판소 탄핵 심판 끝까지 행동하겠습니다.

지난 12월 14일, 국민들의 목소리로 '윤석열 대통령의 탄핵 소추안 가결'이라는 역사교과서의 첫 줄을 써내렸습니다. 국민의 승리였고, 대한민국의 권력은 국민으로부터 나온다는 것을 역사 앞에 증명했습니다.
하지만, 변화의 시작에 불과합니다. 다음은 헌법재판소의 탄핵 심판입니다.
훗날 교단에 섰을 때, 위험적 비상계엄을 앞장서 규탄하지 않은 그 어떠한 책임도 지지 않았다는 부끄러운 역사를 가르치는 일이 없도록 탄핵 심판이 끝날 때까지 지켜보겠습니다.
석교사로서의 한 장면을 완성할 때까지 앞장서서 무너진 민주주의를 지켜내겠습니다.

우리가 만들어낸 변화의 몸짓, 민주주의를 지키기 위한 첫걸음이 되었습니다.

12월 3일 비상계엄 선포 이후, 학생회관과 연구강의동에 붙은 대자보를 시작으로 서울교육대학교 총학생회의 시국선언, 전국의 교육대학과 함께한 교대련 시국선언, 그리고 12월 14일 윤석열 탄핵소추안 가결까지, 사상의 여러분의 힘이 있었기에 가능했습니다. 교육자로서 우리가 가르칠 민주주의를 지켜내고자 함께 변화의 목소리를 내주신 학우 여러분께 깊은 감사를 표합니다.

윤석열 탄핵소추안 가결, 끝이 아닌 시작입니다.

윤석열 탄핵소추안은 가결되었지만 아직 헌법재판소의 결정이 남아 있습니다. 우리가 바라던 민주주의를 지켜내고, 잘못을 한 자가 책임을 지는 사회가 만들어지기 위해서는 헌법재판소의 인용 결정이 필요합니다. 우리가 국회의 탄핵소추안 가결을 이끌어냈던 것처럼 민주주의 사회로 나아가는 두 번째 걸음을 내딛기 위해 다시 한번 우리의 목소리를 모아야 합니다.

우리의 목소리가 더 큰 파도가 되어 민주주의를 이루어낼 때까지 함께 행동합시다.
예비교사로서 우리는 민주주의 사회에서 아이들을 가르치고자 하는 마음으로 변화를 외쳤습니다. 우리가 열망한 민주주의 사회까지 얼마 남지 않았습니다. 아이들에게 '우리가 민주주의 사회에서 살아가고 있다'고 부끄러움 없이 말하기 위해 다시 한번 거리로 나가겠습니다. 함께 나가 우리의 목소리를 냅시다.

        desc: `월 15일 10시, 윤석열이 한남동 관저에서 체포되었습니다.
비상계엄 발동 후 43일 만입니다. 내란수괴 체포안은 성재준 총수회의 결도, 적삼파 결도 아래 우리 목소리였습니다. 만약 우리가 억눌리에서, 광장에서, 내달수괴 발당 전에서 대학하러 손에서 체포를 외치지 않았다면 국회로 향한 결단 움직임이 없었을 것입니다. 윤석열 권력의 기세는 총수회의 결의와 싸움으로 무너져 내렸습니다. 체포는 곧 싸움의 성과이자 우리 손으로 쟁취한 승리입니다.

그러나 아직은 안심할 수 없습니다.
반헌법 대결국 윤핵의 수괴에 체포가 집행되었지만 윤핵의, 윤석열은 체포로 마지막 순간까지 자신이 쥐어쥔 수사와 피력의 자리를 강조했습니다. 16일 아침에는 어떤 '의지'를 드러내는 발언이 들렸습니다. 내란수괴 체포는 '완결'이 아닙니다. 윤석열의 내란음모와 반헌법 범죄를 끝까지 밝히고, 국회 해산, 대통령제 지우기, 내란적 질서와의 단절, 새로운 헌법 창출로 나아가는 일이 이제 시작되었습니다. 윤석열의 체포를 만든 결정 투쟁의 중심과 주체들에 자신감을 갖는 일이 필요합니다. 경찰과 국정원의 공포와 사찰, 검찰과 법원의 위협이 지속하여 지금 싸움은 반헌법 대결국사가 되기에도, 인한 시대의 혼란은 깊은 먹임입니다.

우리는 더 싸워야 합니다.
윤석열 체포로 정치적 기회를 포착했듯 내란 모의범들의 주력은 지금 이 순간에도 여차하면 꿈틀거리고 있습니다. 이른 시일 내에 '2라운드'가 열립니다. 내란 모의범들의 '2라운드'는 내각책임제를 향합니다. '윤핵의 실책과 기회를 잡았다' 생각하는 내란 모의범들은 내각책임제라는 이름 아래 '국민 주권'을 외치며, 사실상 국회 쿠데타를 꾀하려고 하고 있습니다. 다시 '윤석열을 박탈시킬' 광장에 나오는 결정을 되살려야 합니다. '다음은 너야'라는 이야기입니다.

내란수괴 윤석열이 체포되었으니 다음은 내란공범 국민의힘 처벌입니다.
광장에 모인 2000 청년들, 농도, 동진, 성재준, 준수, 적삼파 같은 이름 아래 싸워온 이들은 외칩니다. '다음은 국민의힘이다!' 우리는 2라운드를 준비합니다. 거리에 내걸린 수많은 포스터는 "Future Recall"을 전합니다. 윤석열 체포 이후의 광장은 '다음 국민의힘'으로 향합니다. 체포를 만든 2000 청년의 힘이 이제 국민의힘을 향한 공범 처벌의 힘으로, 국회 해산의 사령탑과 전위로 솟아나는 일. 그만한 세계적 파장은 현재 청년들이 보고, 듣고, 참지합니다.

모든 공포 속에 함께 맞닥뜨렸던 지난 12월 9일 청년 당사자 모의 계엄 해제 통과시키지 않았던 그들. 상상할 수 없던 싸움에 함께한 그 이름들이 이제 국민의힘을 향한 싸움으로 이어집니다. 전국 주요 대학 총학생회에서 싸운 윤석열체포청년공동행동이 2030 청년-학생 체포연대입니다.

12월 3일 이후, 시민들은 민주주의를 수호했습니다. 맨손으로 총을 막아내고 온몸으로 탱크를 막아서며 계엄군의 총칼로부터 민주주의를 지켰습니다. 사회 각계각층에서 시국선언을 진행하고 대학가에서는 학생총회를 개최하여 윤석열 탄핵과 민주주의 수호를 위해 행동할 것을 결의했습니다. 추운 겨울날 국회 앞에서, 목소리 내는 계엄하, 납래령에서 직접 국회로 뛰고 행동하며 나라를 지켜내고자 했던 것은 그 누구도 아닌 시민들이었습니다.

반성조차 없는 반국가세력 윤석열은 파면되어야 합니다.
대한민국 헌법 제1조 제1항, 제2항, “대한민국은 민주공화국이다”, “대한민국의 주권은 국민에게 있고, 모든 권력은 국민으로부터 나온다.” 우리는 민주주의를 지키기 위해 탄핵은 잡은 손을 놓지 않았고 끝내 회복하며, 오히려 이 계엄이 정당했으며 말합니다. 이화인과 시민들이 힘으로 이뤄낸 탄핵 소추안 가결과 구속, 그리고 체포 과정 속에서 정당성을 부인하고 끝까지 민주주의를 위협한 윤석열은 국민을 부정한 반국가세력임을 시민들은 인정할 수 없습니다. 이제는 국민의 손으로 민주주의를 지키며 반국가세력을 파면해야 합니다.

해방의 무게를 기억하고 행동하겠습니다.
비상계엄 이후부터 시민들은 매주 토요일에 거리로 나와 윤석열 탄핵을 외치고 있습니다. 그리고 이화여자대학교에서는 1809일 이화인들이 시국선언이 이뤄졌으며 헌 체제에 대한 분노를 담은 개인 대자보들은 이화의 풍경이 되었습니다. 그리고 12월 13일, 조금 넘으면 2,657명의 이화인들이 총학생회장 성사 서명에 참여하셨습니다. 학교 곳곳의 대자보에서, 광화문 거리에서 만난 수많은 이화인들 졸업생들 분들께 우리 모두가 해방의 무게를 느끼고 있음을 느낍니다. 우리가 바라는 세상이 올 때까지 해방의 이름을 느끼고 정의 안에서 함께 행동하겠습니다. 지난 오랜 이화의 역사 속에서 선배들이 지켜오신 민주주의 역사를 기억하며, 여성과 민족 해방을 위해 세워진 이화인의 목소리로 외쳐나가겠습니다.

하나, 해방이화, 민주주의와 해방의 역사 끝까지 지켜내자
하나, 해방이화, 2,657의 이화인과의 약속, 윤석열 파면까지 함께하자

윤석열 탄핵 광장이 열린 이후 광장에 나오는 개인 참가자, ‘비조직 연대자’들이 늘어나고 있다. 바태렐에서는 알밤봉 동지들이 전국농민총연맹의 트랙터 시위에 몸을 구르며도 경찰의 차벽에 맞서 연대했고, 전국장애인차별철폐연대의 출근길 지하철 선전전에서도 말발굽 달리라는 시민 동지들이 함께하며 경찰과 지하철 보안관들의 강제 퇴거를 막아냈다. 토요일마다 열리는 탄핵 광장에는 각종 ‘개인들의 말’이 각자 목소리를 가득 메운다.

이화여자대학교에서는 수많은 이화인들이 학생총회 선거에 진심을 다했다. 선본들의 공약을 내걸고 학생총회 회의를 거치며 직접 민주주의의 단계를 결정하고, 총회 결과로 이화인들의 뜻을 보내기도 하고, 실력과 직접 민주적 비판들이 등장했다. 물론 후보자 선거 시기도 다르지 않았다. 선거 이외의 모든 학생 단위들은 학교 시설의 낙후함과 미비함에 비판하며, 학내 단위들의 성명서를 지지하거나 반대했다.

물었다, 이제 모든 사람들이 물어야 하는 것은 ‘정치’와 어떻게 다른가? 윤석열의 탄핵을 촉구하는 시민들이나 학생총회에 참여하는 이화인들이나 각자의 삶에서 일상 속 ‘정치’를 했다는 점에서는 전혀 다르지 않다. 이는 사회적 책임감의 차이다. 자신의 목소리를 표명하고, 자신이 살아가는 공동체에 대한 의견을 표명하고, 유무형의 영향을 끼치기를 바라는 것 일체가 바로 정치다. 모두의 일상이 정치이며도 정치가 고작 뚫 안에 가려져 수 있다는 인식은 시민 간의 연대를 모조리 끊어낸다.

불순한 광장에서 다시 보자
직접 문화가 된 광장의 응원봉은 광장 내 배제와 차별도 함께 비춘다. 탄핵 촉구 집회의 현장에서 비조직 연대자들은 특정 사회운동 단체의 ‘역인’인 것을 곧도록 꺼린다. 무지개 행동의 집회 포스터 디자인에 응원봉의 이미지가 들어가는 것에 항의하는 ‘헬겔’, ‘응원봉에 헬겔의 의미부여 금지’라는 문구를 광장에서 보았다는 증언, 수많은 개인 깃발들.

프로 “어떤 집단과도 엮이지 않을’ 개인이자 일반인을 강조하는 연대자의 사례이다. 특정 집단 소속의 아픔을 강조해야 하는 이유는 막연하게 따라 다르겠지만, 여기에는 분명히 단체가 이름을 포함하고 탄핵의 정치화를 흐리는 데에 ‘동일인’ 되는 것을 거부하는 몸짓이 있다.

광장에 있는 이름은 서로를 이용하거나 서로에게 이용당하는 것이 아니다. 우리는 비인간 동물권, 퀴어-페미니스트, 비인간 동물, 정신장애인, 성노동자, 빈자, 학생, 이 사회의 소외되고 차별받는 소수자의 존재를 가시화한다. 무얼 지우건 무얼 희미화하건 존재적으로는 허상이다. 그래도 우리가 목격하는 광장에 펼쳐놓은 문제의식은 시민적 권리의 보장에 있다. 깃발을 들거나 응원봉을 들거나 깃발을 들지 않거나, 시민적 권리 보장과 배제를 넘어선 연대에서만 도래할 것이다.

‘선택적’ 연대와 탄핵 국민에서의 일그러진 중립 지키기는 앞으로의 선택지가 아니다. 불평등과 착취, 억압을 만들어내는 모든 것을 바꿔나가야 하지 않겠는가.

어떤 사안을 위해서 힘을 모을 때, 그것은 그 자체로 정치적이며 거의 반드시 ‘논란’이 된다. 하지만 우리의 연결을 믿고 두려워하지 말자. 너무 정치적이라는 이유로 피했던 공론장에 적극적으로 참석하고, 너무 불온하다는 이유로 연대를 ‘일반적’인 소수자들과 서슴없이 함께하자. 모든 광장은 특정 현장이 아닌, 어떤 몸들이 존재할 수 있는 권리의 장소이자, 구체적인 권리 쟁취를 위한 물리적 장소로 기능할 수 있다. 우리에게 그 자체로 정치적이고 연결이다. 우리의 일상이 혜로남 범죄적 엘리트만이 대통령을 꿈꾸고, 날아빠질 권력을 꿈꾸지 못하도록, 지금과 같은 모든 독점의 국면을 깨기 위해 전진하자. 많은 곳들에서 윤한 끝에 전진하자. 바로 그럴 때, 경계는 뻗뻗불로 연결되어, 넘어져, 모든 존재의 해방이 올 것이다.

노조 파괴에 맞선 세종호텔 부당해고 노동자가 고공농성하고 있다. 산업 현장에서는 불안정한 신입의 이주노동자가 죽어가고 있다. 농민의 트랙터가, 학교의 민주주의가, 공공주택 보급 사업이 공권력의 이름으로 가로막혔다. 정상에 포섭되지 않은 사람들은 자의든 타의든 정처, 권리와 의무, 양방대의 정치, 삶을 영위하지 않는 자들과 이런 나라를 만들었다. 윤석열은 스스로 국민을 “계엄”했다 평가하지만, 계엄을 지나며 폭로된 것은 우리가 감각한 밤중에 있다는 사실이었다.

우리는 어둠에 지지 않고 광장에 모였다. 서로가 어떤 시절을 겪었는지 말하고 들었다. 같은 어둠을 지닌 사람을 위로하고, 다른 어둠을 지닌 이들과 포개졌다. 탄핵 국면을 통해 우리는 단결했고, 함께 꿈을 만들어갔다. 윤석열과 함께 우리가 걷는 어둠도 함께 쫓아내기로 약속했다.

탄핵을 넘어 평등을 꿈꾸는 이들은 시끄럽고 번거로운 민주주의를 위해 치열하게 싸운다. 집회의 자유는 독재 정권이 필사적으로 억압했던 권리이며 광장을 열어낸 것은 맞서 투쟁하는 시민들이었다. 극우 세력의 광장조차 그 투쟁의 토양에서 만들어졌다는 사실을 잊지 말라.

탄핵 반대 세력은 무엇을 위해 단결하는가? 윤석열의 나라를 지키기 위해 단결한다면 그것은 비참하다. 민주주의를 외치면서 윤석열을 비호한다면 그것은 기만이다. 우리의 힘으로, 윤석열은 반드시 파면될 것이다. 윤석열과 전광훈 등의 극우 선동, 혐오와 차별의 언어 밖으로 나가자. 우리는 그 다음으로, 더 나은 민주주의로 가자.

윤석열은 그 존재 자체로 반노동이다. 윤석열 3년 동안 노동정책과 노동권은 차참하게 퇴보했다. 2022년 6월, 대우조선의 하청노동자 유최한 부지회장은 임금 회복과 노조 인정을 요구하며 가로세로 1미터의 감옥을 직접 용접하여 스스로를 가뒀다. 유최한 부지회장이 “이대로 살 순 없지 않습니까?”라고 물으며, 그는 죽음의 문턱까지 갔다. 그렇게 죽으라는 대한민국이었다. 문재인은 노사 법치주의로 내세워 건설노조 ‘깡직이’라 부르며 탄압하였고, 끝내 건설노조 간부 양회동 열사가 스스로 몸에 불을 붙여 분신하도록 만들었다. 건설노조가 요란한 것은 죽지 않고 일하는 현장에 있었기 때문이다. 윤석열은 노동자가 유혈한을 택해야 단 69시간 노동을 가능하게 하는 근로기준법을 개악할 수 있었다. 윤석열이 떠난다고 끝나지 않는다. 노동해방을 향한 발걸음이다.

윤석열 정권은 달가기만 했다. 노동자의 목숨값은 9평짜리 컨베이어였다. 2022년 SPC 계열사 SPL 제빵공장에서 20대 노동자가 기계에 빨려 들어가 숨졌다. 10개월 후 SPC 계열사 샤니 제빵공장에서도 또다시 끼임 사고로 50대 노동자가 숨졌다. 수많은 노동자가 철골에서 떨어지고, 깔판 블록에 깔렸다. 작업대에서 질식한 노동자가 있었고 병원에서 숨졌다. 윤석열은 집권 3년 내내 일하다가 죽은 사람의 죽음이, 일하다가 살해당한 사람의 죽음은 길바닥에 묻히길 바랐다.

길바닥으로 몰린 사람들은 끝내 목소리를 냈다. 손에 무엇을 가진 것보다 갇힌 가슴에 비수를 품고 노동자로 섰다. 우리의 광장은 여기서 끝이 아니다. 윤석열 퇴진은 노동 해방을 향한 첫 발걸음일 뿐이다. 노동자노는 살아 움직이며 실천한다. 노동자는 알아들을 때까지 설명하는 사람들이고, 야근의 힘줄도 모으며서 손님을 맞이하는 사람들이다. 와이어 브러시와 새로 바뀐 문건지 마침내는 녹슨 쇠에도 빛을 내는 사람들이다. 우리가 나아가야 할 길은 노동자 우리는 이미 알고 있다. 억사의 주인 노동자와 연대하여 세상을 바꾸자.

2023년 산재 사망자 수는 598명이었다. 얼마나 더 많은 노동자가 퇴근하지 못해야 하는가. 악질 자본과 결탁한 권력은 얼마나 더 많은 노동자를 죽여야 끝일까. 왜 노동자들이 일하다 죽지 않겠다고 단식하고, 고공에 올라가고, 분신해야 하는가. 윤석열은 끝내 그 내면 깊숙이 연대의 의식을 내세운 이들을 탓한다. 윤석열의 징벌은 땅을 딛고 선 모든 노동자의 노동권과 노동3권 보장을 위해 투쟁하자. 해고자 복직과 노조법 2·3조 개정에 연대하자. 노동법안 비정규직 철폐를 향해 나아가자. 뺏겨진 권리를 되찾는 노동자에 맞서 발을 정쳐하자. 노동 해방 그날까지 구호를 지치자. 우리의 길은 힘찬 단결투쟁뿐이다.

        desc: `내란수괴 윤석열은 결국 법기술을 동원해 감옥에서 나왔다. 3월 7일, 서울중앙지법은 윤석열 구속 취소를 결정하며, 구속 기간 종료 후 기소가 이루어졌다는 주장을 인용했다. 3월 8일, 결정장을 수취하고 권한을 포기하는 것에 대한 특수분납 반발에도 불구하고 윤석열은 석방되었다. 내란은 시민들의 기본적인 인권을 묵살하며 축소되었으며, 내란의 우두머리인 윤석열은 건진해도, 탈옥에 가까운 수법으로 석방되었다. 이러한 검찰의 구속취소 결정은 윤석열을 파면하지 말라는, 헌법재판소를 향한 무언의 압박이나 다름없다.

윤석열이 돌아오면 우리는 이전과 같은 일상을 누릴 수 없다. 윤석열은 극우 세력을 선동해 대통령직으로의 복귀를 준비하고 있다. 지난 ‘실수’를 만회하겠다고 더욱 빠르게 독재를 향해 달려갈 것이며, 시민들은 울부짖고 모란다. 시민은 정당이 아니라 광장에 내민만 부당하게 국가 폭력의 제물이 되도록 만든다. 우리는 4.19 혁명, 5.18 민주항쟁, 6월 항쟁과 같이 독재에 맞서 민주주의를 쟁취하기 위한 투쟁과, 이를 저열하게 탄압하는 국가폭력과 마주했다. 윤석열은 석방 이후 더 우뚝세워, 윤석열을 파면해야 한다. 헌법재판소의 판결을 앞당기고, 확실한 반민정치의 파면 신호를 위해서는 우리가 더 넓게, 더 강하게 모여야 한다.

탄핵 반대를 주장하는 극우들은 지역에서, 대학가에서 세를 넓히고 있다. 이들은 “얼공” 등 허위사실을 유포하면서, 내란세력의 청산을 요구하고 민주주의와 다양성의 가치를 인정하는 이들에게 공정과 진영연합 리더적 속임수를 섞지 않는다. 사부재 부동과 함께 대학가에서 극우 유튜버들도 동일한 사각전선에서 설 수 있었던 것처럼, 파면 결정이 어떻게 나는, 이들은 민주주의의 주요한 대적자들이 될 것이다.

우리는 이들에 맞서 강고한 연대의 가치를 보여주자. 1인시위에 나서고, 매일 저녁 7시 국회 앞에서 열리는 집회에 참여하자, 파면을 촉구하는 목소리를 높이고, 집회 참여를 독려하자. 한강건너에서 수많은 사람들이, 엄허의 날씨를 견디며 윤석열의 파면을 외치고 있다. 내란의 우두머리 윤석열을 다시 구속시키는 것은 시민과 노동자들의 더 큰 힘을 요구할 것이다. 구호를 높이고, 윤석열을 체포했던 것처럼, 우리가 산처럼 모여 윤석열 파면의 우리의 못칼을 보여주자.

윤석열을 석방한 법원을 규탄한다. 즉시항고 포기한 검찰을 규탄한다.
함께는 윤석열을 조속히 파면하라. 우리의 힘으로 민주주의 쟁취하라!

지난 3월 7일, 윤석열의 구속 취소가 결정되었다. 70년 간 이어져온 관행을 깨고, 형법 교과서와 공무원 시험문제와도 다르게 구속 기간을 계산하면서 구속을 취소한 것이다. 광장에 나와있던 시민들은 분노하고, 즉시 항고하며 다시 구속할 것을 요구했다. 검찰은 구속취소에 대한 항고를 포기하고 “절차상 원칙에 따른 결정이었다” 말하며 “즉시 항고를 포기한 것은 불복하지 않는 절차와 원칙에 따른 결정이다” 것이라며 귀책했다.

윤석열 구속 취소, 사법부의 2차 내란이다
내란수괴의 죄가 명백한 현 시국에서 구속 취소가 웬말인가? 지난 대한민국을 만들어 온 선거와 주권자의 권리를 무시하고, 수많은 시민들의 피로 세운 민주주의를 지워버린다. 국민들이 기억나지 않는가? 시민에게 총칼을 겨눈 자가, 이제는 동료 시민 서로에게 총칼을 누누라고 한다면. 반헌법적인 반사회적인 목소리가 이 사회에 울리는 것을 보고만 있어야 하는가? 작금의 사태는 12월 3일 정부부의 내란과 다를 바 없는 사법부의 2차 내란이다.

서울여자대학교의 슬로건대로 “우리는 나보다 강합니다.”
개인으로 존재하는 ‘우’와 ‘나’는 오랫동안 침묵하였습니다.

오늘 ‘우’라는 살기 위해 자유를 외치며, 대한민국의 자유민주주의와 여성의 권리를 수호하기 위해 윤석열 대통령에 대한 부당한 탄핵 시도를 규탄합니다.

계엄령은 부정선거를 저지하기 수사하기 위한 불가피한 조치였습니다. 선거관리위원회의 심각한 보안 파괴와 대법원의 부정선거 묵인 속에서, 기존의 사법 절차만으로는 진실을 밝혀낼 수 없었습니다. 윤석열 대통령은 부패한 사법카르텔을 끊고 자유민주주의를 지키기 위해 결단을 내린 것입니다.

부정선거는 단순한 국내 문제가 아닌 중국의 하이브리드 전략의 일환입니다. 한국이 부정선거 카르텔에 휘말리면, 동아시아 시민사회 전체에서 고립될 위험이 있으며, 이는 미래의 삶과 존엄 자체의 붕괴로 이어질 것입니다. 윤석열 대통령의 계엄령은 대한민국이 종속의 사슬에서 벗어나기 위한 필요조건이었습니다.

민주당은 부패한 한국 카르텔을 중국의 이익에 복무시키며, 안보를 위협하는 행위를 서슴지 않았습니다. 선거의 정당성을 훼손하고, 사법부를 장악하여 법치를 파괴하며, 대한민국을 준-주가로 만들려는 변질시키고 있습니다. 윤석열 대통령이 계엄령과 자유민주주의 수호 의지를 불법적으로 탄핵하려는 시도는 명백한 내란 행위입니다.

우파 정권은 실질적으로 여성 인권을 보호하며, 법과 제도를 통해 여성의 안전과 기회를 보장해왔습니다. 반면, 좌파 성향의 정권은 정치적 도구로 삼으며 위선적인 혜택을 일삼았습니다. 우리는 여성 인권을 인질로 삼는 과거에 더 이상 이용당하지 않을 것입니다.

기독교 정신으로 남녀 평등 실현을 위해 설립된 ‘우리’ 서울여자대학교 우파 여성들은 자유민주주의의 수호자로서 오늘 선언합니다.

하나, 우리는 윤석열 대통령에 대한 부당한 탄핵을 반대합니다.
하나, 우리는 부정선거 의혹을 날날이 수사하길 요구합니다.
하나, 우리는 민주당을 위시한 친중 카르텔의 반국가 행위를 규탄합니다.

        desc: `- 여대연합 탄핵반대 시국선언 성명문 요약본 -

2025년의 대한민국 여성들에게 우파 정당은 ‘여성혐오’ 당이다. 대부분의 여성들에게 현 여당은 절대로 지지할 수 없는 당이며 민주당이어야만로 여성을 위한 당이라는 인식이 뇌리에 박혀 있다. 하지만 실상은 어떠한가?

민주당은 겉으로는 여성 보호를 외치지만 실상은 그렇지 않다. 경찰 돌려막기를 생각하며 마약 및 딥페이크 수사를 방해했고, 내부 성범죄를 비판한 박지현 전 비대위원장은 축출됐다. 민주당은 여성 인권을 외치지만 실제로는 성범죄 앞에서 침묵하는 것이다. 또한, 민주당은 오래전부터 공산주의 세력과 결탁해 간첩들의 군사 기밀 유출을 방조하고, 친중·친북 인사들과 탄핵 시국선언을 주도했다. 이미 민주당은 중국 공산당과 한 몸이 된 것이 아닌가?

실제로 공산주의 세력 아래 여성들은 착취당해왔다. 중국은 위구르 여성들에게 강제피임과 성폭행을 자행하며, 북한 여성들은 성범죄 개입조차 묵묵히 참아야 한다. 탄핵 여론은 중국 성매매 시장으로도 팔려가고, 중국 밀입이 들어간 카카오톡에서는 ‘여성인권’이라는 단어조차 금지하고 있다.

반면 우파 정당 대통령들은 여성을 위한 진정한 정책을 펼쳐왔다. 이승만 초대 대통령은 여성 참정권과 교육권을 제도화했다. 박정희 전 대통령은 여성 노동권을 보장했고, 전두환 전 대통령은 호주제 개편을 시도했다. 지금 여성인권에 앞에 든 탄핵대 반국대 학투라는 폭행, 협박과 연동일키 뒤를 갈고 있으나 좌파와 주류 언론은 이를 외면한다.

우리는 작금의 하이브리드 전쟁에서 반드시 승리해 나라가 공산주의의 사슬에 묶일 위기를 넘어가야 한다. 자유민주주의를 지켜야만 좌우가 균형을 맞추며 서로 경쟁하고 토론하며 이 사회를 발전시켜 나갈 수 있다. 이미 극우라는 비난을 받고 있는 수많은 학생들 “우파”로 보나 있는 많은 학생들이 대담하게 진실을 외치기를 바라며, 비난이 아닌 상호비판이 자유로운 사회가 되기를 간절히 바란다.

대한민국 여성들은 이제 ‘좌파 정당만이 여성을 위한다’는 인식에서 벗어나야 한다. 그리고 자유민주주의를 수호하는 여대 연합 학생들은 선언한다.

하나, 우리는 윤석열 대통령을 향한 불법 탄핵에 반대한다.
하나, 우리는 부정선거의 정황이 있는 선거관리위원회를 공정하게 수사할 것을 요구한다.
하나, 우리는 친중 친북 카르텔의 반국가 행위를 규탄한다.

인내의 시간은 끝났다. 더 이상은 기다릴 수 없다. 민중들의 삶은 여전히 지난 해 12월 3일 윤석열이 비상계엄을 선포했던 그 밤에 머물러 있다. 동이 터도 동이 트지 않았고, 해가 지내도 해가 지나지 않았으며, 날이 풀려도 날이 풀리지 않았다. 우리는 아직 처참, 혐오, 탄압, 반민주, 개악을 일삼다 끝내는 ‘처단’을 명령하고 독재를 시도한 윤석열 정권의 비참한 최후를 보지 못했다.

더 이상 헌법재판소의 시간을 기다릴 수 없다. 인내의 문제가 아니다. 생존의 문제다. 헌법재판소가 윤석열 파면 선고의 시간을 기약 없이 끄는 동안 민생 경제는 파탄에 이르렀고, 민주주의는 처참하게 훼손되고 있다. 헌법재판소가 내린 둔중한 한숨속의 탄핵을 기각하는 동안 광장에 선 민중들은 또 한 번 배신당했다. 우리의 삶이 여전히 위협받고 있다. 더는 주저하며 망설이는 헌법재판소를 보고만 있을 수 없다. 더 이상의 인내는 불가능하다.

민중의, 노동자의 피와 저항으로 전진해온 한국 사회다. 우리는 윤석열이 군대를 동원해 ‘처단’하고 ‘숙거’하려던 찰나의 순간에도 치열하게 저항하며 우리의 일상을 지켜냈다. 계속해서 거리로, 광장으로 나갔다. 이번에도 반드시 전진할 것이다. 우리의 저항으로 끔찍한 정권의 비참한 끝을 반드시 마주하고야 말 것이다.

3월 27일, 노동을, 학업을 멈추고 광장으로 가자. 노동자가 멈추면 세상이 멈춘다. 세상을 돌아가게 만드는 우리가 세상을 멈추는 힘을 보여주자. 지금 이 순간 일말의 희망을 품고 있을 윤석열에게 끔찍한 절망을 선사하자. 주저와 망설임에는 헌법재판소에 노동자 민중의 압력을 보여주자. 마침내 동이 틀 수 있도록, 해가 지날 수 있도록, 날이 풀릴 수 있도록 투쟁하자.

성공회대학교 노학연대 ‘가시’도 윤석열 정권의 최후를 향해, 마침내 올 새 세상을 향해 뾰족뾰족하게 투쟁할 것이다. 우리의 안전한 일상을 쟁취해낼 것이다. ‘마침내 거리고 광장이다. 자유와 평등 해방 깃발 들고 우리는 간다.’ 3월 27일, 일을 멈추고 우리 모두 광장에서 함께하자.

윤석열 정권은 끝났지만, 우리의 투쟁은 끝나지 않았다. 아니, 이제 시작이다. 내란 수괴를 파면하기 위해서는 처절하게 투쟁해야 하는 사회에서, 자본의 폭력에 매년 2000여 명 노동자가 죽음으로 내몰리는 사회에서, 구조적 차별과 혐오에 맞서 성평등과 평등권을 쟁취해야 하는 노동당원의 한국 사회에서, 학내 민주주의를 위해 학생들이 수 개월째 싸워야만 하는 사회에서, 자아실현을 막는 이유로 장애인을 강제입감하고 차별하는 사회에서, 교내 성폭력 사건의 문제를 제기한 교사를 해임하고 연대하는 시민들을 연행해가는 사회에서, 이윤을 위해 자연을 수탈하고 파괴하는 사회에서, 팔레스타인인을 학살하는 전범국 이스라엘에 무기를 수출하는 사회에서 신천지와 요구를 질질 지난 ‘중복 프레임’으로 몰아 탄압하는 사회에서 이제 대통령 하나를 끌어내렸을 뿐이다.

탄핵 이후 다시 만날 세계에서는, 모든 억압과 착취에 맞서 사회 구조를 바꾸어야 한다. 대통령 파면을 넘어, 내란 잔당을 청산하고 차별금지법 제정과 노조법 2·3조 개정을 이루어야 한다. 비정규직 철폐, 안전한 일터, 기후 정의, 전쟁 반대, 학내 민주주의 확대, 구조적 차별 철폐와 평등한 사회를 타파하고 평등임도 동원임도 원칙을 확립해야 한다. 보수 야당까지 뛰어넘는 진보정치를 만들어야 한다. 여기에 멈추지 않고, 두 번이나 실패한 대통령을 배출한 6공화국 체제 자체를 뒤엎어야 한다. 한 번의 실수는 우연일 수 있지만, 두 번의 실패는 구조의 문제이기 때문이다.

박근혜 퇴진운동 당시 근본적인 변화는 탄핵 이후로 미루며 광장의 정치를 외쳐 내부분만 제한하려 했던 시도는 오늘날 윤석열을 대통령으로 만들었다. ‘적폐 청산’을 내걸었던 문재인 정부는 그러나 체제의 한계를 벗어나지 못했고, 고공부문 비정계 개혁, 최저임금 1만원 시대 등의 공약은 결국 지켜지지 않았다. 문재인 정부가 약속했던 적폐 청산과 검찰 개혁의 실패는 검찰총장 윤석열의 방임으로 이어졌다. 모처럼 광장의 민주주의가 다시 찾아오는 지금, 우리는 같은 실수를 다시 풀어내서는 안 될 것이다.

변화를 두려워하는 이들은 언제나 그랬듯 아직은 때가 아니라고 할 것이다. 그러나 모든 변화는 시기상조이다. 다만 투쟁으로 때 이를 변화를 쟁취할 뿐이다. 지난 네 달간 광장은 투쟁하는 사람들의 네트워크를 구축했다. 탄핵을 외치며 광장에 나선 시민들은 곧이어 민주노총으로, 전농으로, 전장연으로, 동덕여대로, 팔레스타인으로, 세종문화회관 거울공조선학생회장 행동장으로, 지혜북 서퍼 프레임으로 몰린 단압을 이겨냈다. 따라서 이제는 탄핵을 넘어 사회 변혁으로, 차별과 혐오를 넘어 연대로, 착취를 넘어 평등으로 나아갈 때이다. 허울뿐인 민주주의를 지나 민중 권력을 쟁취하자. 우리 29개 청년 학생 단체 역시 그 투쟁을 함께 이어나갈 것을 결의한다.

차별에 지지 않고 투쟁했던 사람들이 있다. 거대한 힘 앞에서 주저하지 않고 달려나갔던 사람들이 오늘의 파면을 만들었다. 삶에서 차별받은 이들, 그렇게 일상이 게임이었다던 사람들은 광장에서 자신의 존재를 알리기 위해, 목소리를 내기 위해 투쟁했다. 날카로운 바람을 서로의 온기로 이겨내며 끝까지 투쟁해왔고, 투쟁할 것이다.

파면 이후 우리는 끝이자 새로운 시작 앞에 서 있다.

금속노조 김형수 동지, 세종호텔에서 해고된 고진수 동지 그리고 윤리감학 이태근의 박경석 상순숙 동지는 노동을 위해 공공에서 투쟁했다. 전국장애인차별철폐연대는 아침마다 존엄을 위해 투쟁했다. 공장안의 노동자들은 생명을 담보한 채로 노동해야 한다. 여성, 장애인, 노인, 청소노동자, 비인간, 빈곤에 떠밀린 차별은 여전히 만연하다.

이미 윤석열의 파면은 모든 투쟁의 종결로 이어질 수 없다. 광장에서 우리가 ‘함께’를 확인했다면, 이제는 ‘함께’ 살아가야할 때다. 녹슨 체제와 사회를 직면하며, ‘다시 만날 세계’를 치열하게 고민해야 한다. 두렵고, 또 두렵더라도, 소리내어 봐야한다.

우리는 약속한다.

연대할 것이다.

4월의 긴 시간을 녹아내리며 눈이 녹고 꽃이 필 때까지, 총학생회와 중앙운영위원회, 학내 각지 단위 및 권리단체, 학우들이 힘을 모아 시작된, 대자보, 현수막, 항공장치, 참여와 동참 유혹에 느긋히 둘러앉아 연대하고 투쟁하며 이어가야했지만, 잊지않았다. 사라지지 않았다. 1980년대, 민주화를 위한 투쟁의 광장에서 “해방”이라는 이름을 꺼내기 전까진 아직, 2016년 박근혜 정권 최전의 꿈을 아직 안고 있는 이들의 착취와 파산, 위력적인 질식은 지속되는 역사였다. 학내의 회의장과 강당은 결코 지워지지 않는 불편한 찰나들 안에서는 질긴 잎들로 남아있는 시인들의 언어였던, 거리를 지우고 시대를 해명하려는 반역의 불안이다.

내란안의 파면을 정당화하지 않는다. 학내의 투쟁을 정당화하지 않는다.
노동자, 민중이 내내 모든 억압의 쇠사슬도 뛰어넘는 민주주의의 새날 작은 내막, 작은 세밀함을 우리는 안다.
빛으로 돌아올 것이다. 이제는 숨을 참고 묻으며 나가자.

내란 동시세어 하나는 청소신림 알뜰들 내지 못할 명거가 빠름짜 뿌림뿌림.
다시 만날 세상은 노동자의 것, 농민의 것, 학생의 것, 했던지 모든 이의 것으로 이등지고 간다.
이제 훅실씨움이 지나갔음은 묻으며, 희망의 시류로 귀환할 때, 밀거래 기묘지휘 투쟁하자.
파면이, 작별의, 불통들이, 외침, 사람의 목소리들 도타 권력을 젖은 자본주의의 신자유주의에 맞서자.

주문, 피청구인 윤석열 대통령을 파면한다.
주문, 모든 권력을 탄핵의 칼날을 거침한다.
5월 1일, 노동절까지, 다시 탄핵 정의의 길로 가자. 항쟁의 이름으로 억장과 억장이 다른 눈이 즐거.
세상에 그걸 전하자, 주주주의 될 것이다.

        desc: `4월 4일 헌법재판소의 ‘윤석열 파면’ 선고를 환영하며,
모든 내란을 종식하기 위한 투쟁을 이어갈 것을 다짐한다

“지금 시각은 오전 11시 22분입니다. 주문, 피청구인 대통령 윤석열을 파면한다.”

헌법재판소의 파면 선고를 환영한다
2025년 4월 4일 오전 11시 22분, 헌법재판소는 재판관 전원의 일치된 의견으로 피청구인 대통령 윤석열 파면을 선고했다. 광장의 열기에 8:0으로 답한 헌법재판소의 결정을 두 팔 벌려 환영한다. 12월 3일 계엄 이후 매일같이 광장에 모였던 우리는 비로소 내란 수괴 윤석열을 끌어내리며, 민주주의가 회복되는 순간을 맞이했다. 광장을 지켜온 우리는 서로의 뜨거운 손을 맞잡으며 눈물과 환호로, 강장의 축제로 다시 한 번 화답했다.
우리는 헌법재판소의 파면 선고를 환영한다. 지금은 사상 민주주의의 위기가 걷잡을 수 없이 확산됨에 유감을 표한다. 윤석열이 비상계엄령을 선포한 지 123일 만에 내려진 이번 선고는, 마치 5월의 잎이 열리고 고뇌로 걷다, 내란 수괴 윤석열에게 맞닿은 당연한 결과이었다. 그러나 그간의 고뇌와 행보, 그동안 맞서는 극단적으로 분열됐으며, 극우 세력에 점철되어 있던 시간들, 시름을 감히 환호로 평가하지 않으며 끝까지 싸울 것을 이야기해야 한다.

이 기세를 몰아 모든 내란을 종식하자
윤석열이 대통령직에서 파면되었다고 해서 내란이 종식된 것은 아니다. 윤석열이 임명한 국무위원들이 자리를 당당히 꿰 차지고 있고, 극우의 집결지가 되고 있는 내란청장 국민의힘이 해산하지 않고 버티며 있지 않은가. 지금도 거리에는 내란을 옹호하는 극우패들이 민주 시민들을 위협하며 폭력을 행사하고 있고, 국민의힘은 이들의 폭력 행위를 선동하고 있다. 모든 내란을 종식하자. 저들이 파괴한 민주주의를 청년학생·노동자·시민의 직접 정치로 재건하기 위해 다시금 흐름을 가다듬고 투쟁에 나설 때다.

내란을 끝장낸 바로 그 힘으로 새로운 세상을 건설하자
윤석열 파면은 끝이 아니라 시작이다. 우리가 함께 이루어낸 이 소중한 승리는 청년학생과 노동자, 시민이 하나로 뭉쳐 민주주의를 지켜낸 증거이자, 우리 스스로 더 나은 미래를 앞당겨 낼 수 있다는 가능성의 증명이었다. 우리는 이 승리의 기세를 몰아 한국 사회에 뿌리박힌 체제, 불평등의 구조로 근본적으로 전환해야 한다. 노동이 존중받는 사회, 성별과 성적 지향에 따라 차별받지 않는 사회, 청년이 일을 하며도 희망을 가질 수 있는 사회를 향한 장정에 이제 첫 칼날을 내딛은뿐이다.
내란과 폭력의 광장을 뛰어넘어 맞서 싸운 우리는 불안이야말로 민주주의가 가진 가장 결정적 무기이자 희망이다. 이제는 모든 시민이 존엄한 권리를 쟁취할 것임을 선언하며, 희망의 꿈이 꽃피길 다짐한다. 학생회, 약자의 소수가 차별받지 않는 연대사회와 민주주의 대로 나아가야 한다. 투쟁과 연대는 한국 민주주의·평등사회를 가는 길, 그 길에 윤석열 퇴진을 위한 충북대학교 학생공동행동이 함께할 것이다.

2025년 4월 4일, 우리의 첫 번째 희망이 이루어진 날에`

        desc: `2025년 4월 4일, 윤석열은 대통령직에서 파면되었다.
123일 간 시민들은 윤석열 파면을 요구하며 꾸준히 광장으로, 거리로 나왔다.
부정에 침묵하지 않은 이들의 힘으로 윤석열은 파면되었다.

4개월의 시간 동안, 광장은 투쟁의 장인 동시에 배움의 장이었다.
12월 3일의 국회에서 4월 4일의 헌법재판소에 이르기까지, 광장은 매번 수많은 얼굴들로 채워졌다.
파면과 평등을 위한 대매에 점점 더 많은 이들이 합류했고, 내린 목소리가 이어지면서 광장은 넓어졌다.
광장에서는 윤석열 파면뿐만 아니라 다양한 목소리, 존재되었던 목소리가 울려퍼졌다.
그간의 반갑지 않은 얼굴들 거두어내고, 소외되고 공격받았던 이들의 목소리를 만날 수 있었다.

광장은 사회 문제를 “읽는” 것을 넘어서, 투쟁하는 이들과 직접 대면하고 소통하는 공간이었다.
우리는 연결되었고, 사회 구성원으로서 서로의 존재를 느낄 수 있었다.
언론과 정치에서 보지 못하던 이들, 동덕여대에서 만난 사람들, 성소수자들을 만났다.
낯설었던 공공승선에서 배웠다, 지체 높은 사회 복지 집회에서 만났어도 배웠다.
오랫동안 지속되었고 조명받지 못했던 문제로 노동자들의 투쟁, 특히 플랫폼과 특수고용 노동조합에 대해서도 우리는 광장에서 마주했다.
광장의 만남은 일회적인 사건으로 그치지 않았다.
노래가, 깃발이, 각자의 이정인의 걸침에 모여서 투쟁은 더이상 헐고 고되기만 한 것이 아니었다.
투쟁은 우리 가까이에 있었다.

우리에겐 여전히 남은 과제들도 있다. 싸움이 끝나고 ‘일상’으로 돌아가자는 말은 어떤 사람들을 외롭게 한다.
투쟁이 일상의 일부인 동지들이 있다.
이들을 위해 투쟁하는 장애인, 세종호텔의 부당해고에 맞서 싸우는 노동자, 성폭력 공식피고소자 지체복지 선생님, 택반 농민들, 이들과 투쟁에 우리는 함께해야 한다.

광장에 나오기 어려운, 물리적·사회적 제약 속에 눌린 사람들이 있다.
하루에 하루 먹고 자는 데 쓰이는 힘을 저하여도 싸우는 사람들, 그들은 절대 혼자가 아니다.
특히, 장애인, 여성, 성소수자, 농민, 빈곤층, 비정규직 노동자, 공공부문 비정규직 노동자들.
이들의 요구는 경제적 이익을 추구하는 조직의 요구가 아니며, 결코 후순위가 아니다.
광장을 넘어선 공간에서도 이들이 고립되지 않게, 누구도 혼자 두지 않게 연대해야 한다.
누구나 연대의 이름으로 싸우며, 자신의 작은 필요를 위한 연대를 요청하고, 각자가 작은 싸움으로 살아남고 있다는 점을 기억하자.

동시에, 우리는 정치에 대한 불신과 냉소에 맞서 싸워야 한다.
정치는 자기 일이 아니라며 냉소하는 사람들, 계엄은 부당하지만 사회대개혁은 정치적인 요구라며 부끄럽다는 목소리가 있었다.
그러나 우리가 먼저 정치를 찾지 않으면, 정치는 언제나 먼저 우리를 쓸쓸히 찾는다.
계엄의 정당함이 말이다.
계엄은 평범한 한국 사회에 살고 있는 모두를 위협하는 사건이었다.
우리는 모두 정치의 당사자이다.
나와 타인의 삶의 조건에 관심을 가질 때 더 나은 사회를 만날 수 있다.

계엄에서 우리는 독재의 명령을 가장 명확한 방식으로 확인했다.
그러나 민중들은 광장으로 나왔고, 자신의 손으로 변화를 이끌었다.
정치는 권력자들의 일방적인 요청이었다.
상상하지 못했던 연대의 만남이었으며, 연대를 통한 작업의 확장과 행동의 역량이었다.
정치의 한계는 있다.
정치의 한계는 연대의 무게로 넘는다.
싸움의 순간에서 서로를 향한 연대의 무게는 어떤 한계를 무력화한다.
정치에 기대지 않아야 할 일들, 정치는 하지 못했던 일들, 연대와 행진으로 이어지는 일들을 스스로 일어나자.
지금까지가 우리는 파면으로 질서를 다지기 위하여 달려왔다면, 중요한 것은 질서 자체를 뒤바꾸는 일이다.
균형없이 반걸음 더 내딛는 일이다.

파면의 기쁨은 앞으로의 투쟁에 밑거름이 된다.
우리는 광장에서 찾았고 알았고, 그곳으로 거리에서 계속 마주할 수 있을 것이다.
광장의 성취는 다시 정치 교체로만 끝나지 않는다.
광장의 승리는 서로 다른 우리의 만남이다.
깃발 찰리며 노래하며, 함께 나아가자.
